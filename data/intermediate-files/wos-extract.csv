"Purpose: Employment opportunities for graduating pediatric surgeons vary from year to year. Significant turnover among new employees indicates fellowship graduates may be unsophisticated in choosing job opportunities which will ultimately be satisfactory for themselves and their families. The purpose of this study was to assess what career, life, and social factors contributed to the turnover rates among pediatric surgeons in their first employment position. Methods: American Pediatric Surgical Association members who completed fellowship training between 2011 and 2016 were surveyed voluntarily. Only those who completed training in a pediatric surgery fellowship sanctioned by the American Board of Surgery and whose first employment involved the direct surgical care of patients were included. The survey was completed electronically and the results were evaluated using chi-squared analysis to determine which independent variables contributed to a dependent outcome of changing place of employment. Results: 110 surveys were returned with respondents meeting inclusion criteria. 13 (11.8%) of the respondents changed jobs within the study period and 97 (882%) did not change jobs. Factors identified that likely contributed to changing jobs included a perceived lack of opportunity for career [p = <0.001] advancement and the desire to no longer work at an academic or teaching facility [p = 0.013]. Others factors included excessive case load [p = 0.006]; personal conflict with partners or staff [p = 0.007]; career goals unfulfilled by practice [p = 0.011]; lack of mentorship in partners [p = 0.026]; and desire to be closer to the surgeon's or their spouse's family [p = 0.002]. Conclusions: Several factors appear to play a role in motivating young pediatric surgeons to change jobs early in their careers. These factors should be taken into account by senior pediatric fellows and their advisors when considering job opportunities. Type of Study: Survey. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

"IMPORTANCE The influence of Tourette syndrome and chronic tic disorders on academic performance has not been objectively quantified. OBJECTIVE To investigate the association of Tourette syndrome and chronic tic disorders with objectively measured educational outcomes, adjusting for measured covariates and unmeasured factors shared between siblings and taking common psychiatric comorbidities into account. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A population-based birth cohort consisting of all individuals born in Sweden from 1976 to 1998 was followed up until December 2013. Individuals with organic brain disorders, mental retardation, and 2 foreign-born parents were excluded. We further identified families with at least 2 singleton full siblings and families with siblings discordant for Tourette syndrome or chronic tic disorders. EXPOSURES Previously validated International Classification of Diseases diagnoses of Tourette syndrome or chronic tic disorders in the Swedish National Patient Register. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Eligibility to access upper secondary school after compulsory education, finishing upper secondary school, starting a university degree, and finishing a university degree. RESULTS Of the 2 115 554 individuals in the cohort, 3590 had registered a diagnosis of Tourette syndrome or a chronic tic disorder in specialist care (of whom 2822 [78.6%] were male; median [interquartile] age at first diagnosis, 14.0 [11- 18] years). Of 726 198 families with at least 2 singleton full siblings, 2697 included siblings discordant for these disorders. Compared with unexposed individuals, people with Tourette syndrome or chronic tic disorders were significantly less likely to pass all core and additional courses at the end of compulsory school (odds ratios ranging from 0.23 [95% CI, 0.20-0.26] for the handcraft textile/ wood course to 0.36 [95% CI, 0.31-0.41] for the English language course) and to access a vocational program (adjusted OR [aOR], 0.31; 95% CI, 0.28-0.34) or academic program (aOR, 0.43; 95% CI, 0.39-0.47) in upper secondary education. Individuals with the disorders were also less likely to finish upper secondary education (aOR, 0.35; 95% CI, 0.32-0.37), start a university degree (aOR, 0.41; 95% CI, 0.37-0.46), and finish a university degree (aOR, 0.39; 95% CI, 0.32-0.48). The results were only marginally attenuated in the fully adjusted sibling comparison models. Exclusion of patients with neuropsychiatric comorbidities, particularly attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and pervasive developmental disorders, resulted in attenuated estimates, but patients with Tourette syndrome or chronic tic disorders were still significantly impaired across all outcomes. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Help-seeking individuals with Tourette syndrome or chronic tic disorders seen in specialist settings experience substantial academic underachievement across all educational levels, spanning from compulsory school to university, even after accounting for multiple confounding factors and psychiatric comorbidities.",,,"Brander, G|de la Cruz, LF|D'Onofrio, BM|Hesselmark, E|Isomura, K|Jangmo, A|Kuja-Halkola, R|Larsson, H|Mataix-Cols, D|Perez-Vigil, A","Brander, Gustaf|de la Cruz, Lorena Fernandez|D'Onofrio, Brian M.|Hesselmark, Eva|Isomura, Kayoko|Jangmo, Andreas|Kuja-Halkola, Ralf|Larsson, Henrik|Mataix-Cols, David|Perez-Vigil, Ana",1098,-1,,,,,,,-1,,-1,,,,,,,,Article,10.1001/jamaneurol.2018.1194,,,,1105,Clarivate Analytics Web of Science,,,,,,2168-6149,9,,,JAMA NEUROLOGY,,,,OBSESSIVE-COMPULSIVE DISORDER|CHILDREN|PREVALENCE|SCHOOL|COMORBIDITIES|DIFFICULTIES|METAANALYSIS|SYMPTOMS|REGISTER|IMPACT,-1,,,,SEP,J,2018,,,,,,Clinical Neurology,,-1,,Neurosciences & Neurology,,0,Association of Tourette Syndrome and Chronic Tic Disorders With Objective Indicators of Educational Attainment A Population-Based Sibling Comparison Study,0,,WOS:000444201900010,1,75,2168-6157,29813161,C:\Users\mginda\Desktop\agc1\wos-extract.isi,"Perez-Vigil A, 2018, V75, P1098, DOI 10.1001/jamaneurol.2018.1194"
"Mixing alcohol with caffeinated energy drinks is a common practice, especially among young people. In humans, the research on this issue has mainly focused on the use of the mass-marketed energy drinks themselves, whereas in animal models, it has focused on the individual effects of their active ingredients (i.e. caffeine). Here, we have characterized how Red Bull (R), one of the most consumed caffeinated energy drink worldwide, modulates operant alcohol self-administration in Wistar rats. We found that animals readily and steadily responded for Red Bull (mean: 90 responses, 30minutes and fixed-ratio 1), which was accompanied by locomotor stimulating effects (26 percent increase). The higher the concentration of alcohol (3-20 percent), the higher the consumption of alcohol (g/kg) and associated blood alcohol levels (91.76 percent) in the mixed Red Bull-alcohol group (60 percent increase). Blood caffeine levels in the Red Bull group were 4.69 mu g/ml and 1.31g/ml in the Red Bull-alcohol group after the 30-minute session. Because Red Bull also contains 11 percent sucrose, we examined the time course of blood glucose as well as insulin and corticosterone. The correlation between intake of Red Bull and blood glucose levels was higher at 90 minutes than 5 minutes after its consumption, and there was no relationship with blood insulin or blood corticosterone levels. Red Bull did not alter extinction and reacquisition of responding for alcohol nor did it affect relapse-like drinking. Overall, our results suggest that Red Bull might be a vulnerability factor to develop alcoholism given that it intensifies the consumption of higher concentrations of alcohol.",,,"Lopez-Moreno, JA|Boehm, SL|Buhler, KM|Calleja-Conde, J|Echeverry-Alzate, V|Gine, E|Gomez-Gallego, F|Maldonado, R|Olmos, P|de Fonseca, FR|Roldan, M|Sanchez-Diez, IJ|Santiago, C","Antonio Lopez-Moreno, Jose|Boehm, Stephen L.|Buhler, Kora-Mareen|Calleja-Conde, Javier|Echeverry-Alzate, Victor|Gine, Elena|Gomez-Gallego, Felix|Maldonado, Rafael|Olmos, Pedro|Rodriguez de Fonseca, Fernando|Roldan, Marta|Sanchez-Diez, Israel J.|Santiago, Catalina",1094,-1,,,,,,,-1,,-1,,,,,,,,Article,10.1111/adb.12560,,,,1105,Clarivate Analytics Web of Science,,,,,,1355-6215,5,,,ADDICTION BIOLOGY,,,,MIXING ALCOHOL|NONALCOHOLIC BEVERAGES|HIGH-RISK|CAFFEINE|ETHANOL|SEEKING|RATS|DEPRIVATION|EXPRESSION|EXPOSURE,-1,,alcohol|energy drink|operant self-administration,,SEP,J,2018,,,,,,Biochemistry & Molecular Biology|Substance Abuse,,-1,,Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Substance Abuse,,0,Red Bull (R) energy drink increases consumption of higher concentrations of alcohol,0,,WOS:000442203900010,1,23,1369-1600,,C:\Users\mginda\Desktop\agc1\wos-extract.isi,"Roldan M, 2018, V23, P1094, DOI 10.1111/adb.12560"
"Objective: Peer victimization in school is common, with emerging literature suggesting that it may also increase risk for substance abuse. Yet, little is known about the underlying mechanisms within this risk pathway. The objective of this study is to use a prospective 3-wave design to examine the mediating role of depressive symptomatology on the relationship between peer victimization and substance use, as well as examine if the pathway varies based on gender. Method: 801 youth between 6th and 12th grade completed surveys across three years, which included measures on school peer victimization, depression symptomatology and substance use. Models tested the mediational pathway between victimization, depressive symptoms, and substance use. Models were stratified by gender. Results: Controlling for grade and the effect of each variable across waves, a significant indirect effect of peer victimization on substance use through depressive symptoms was found for females, with a non-significant indirect effect for males. Conclusion: Results suggest that female youth who are victimized by peers engage in substance use behaviors, at least in part, due to increases in depressive symptoms. Given its effect on depression, female victims may therefore benefit from coping skills training that targets emotion regulation and distress tolerance skills in order to combat increased risk for substance use behaviors as a coping response to their victimization. Further research is warranted to better understand the risk pathway for male youth who also experience peer victimization.",,,"Barnes-Najor, J|Fisher, S|Hensel, DJ|Rowe, AT|Zapolski, TCB","Barnes-Najor, Jessica|Fisher, Sycarah|Hensel, Devon J.|Rowe, Alia T.|Zapolski, Tamika C.

"Background: Causal interpretation of associations between short interpregnancy interval (the duration from the preceeding birth to the conception of the next-born index child) and the offspring's psychological and educational problems may be influenced by a failure to account for unmeasured confounding. Methods: Using population-based Swedish data from 1973-2009, we estimated the association between interpregnancy interval and outcomes [autism spectrum disorder (ASD), attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), severe mental illness, suicide attempt, criminality, substance-use problem and failing grades] while controlling for measured covariates. We then used cousin comparisons, post-birth intervals (the interval between the second-and third-born siblings to predict second-born outcomes) and sibling comparisons to assess the influence of unmeasured confounding. We included an exploratory analysis of long interpregnancy interval. Results: Interpregnancy intervals of 0-5 and 6-11 months were associated with higher odds of outcomes in cohort analyses. Magnitudes of association were attenuated following adjustment for measured covariates. Associations were eliminated for ADHD, severe mental illness and failing grades, but maintained magnitude for ASD, suicide attempt, criminality and substance-use problem in cousin comparisons. Post-birth interpregnancy interval and sibling comparisons suggested some familial confounding. Associations did not persist across models of long interpregnancy interval. Conclusions: Attenuation of the association in cousin comparisons and comparable post-birth interval associations suggests that familial genetic or environmental confounding accounts for a majority of the association for ADHD, severe mental illness and failing grades. Modest associations appear independently of covariates for ASD, suicide attempt, criminality and substance-use problem. Post-birth analyses and sibling comparisons, however, show some confounding in these associations.",,,"Almqvist, C|Class, QA|D'Onofrio, BM|Larsson, H|Lichtenstein, P|Oberg, AS|Rickert, ME|Sujan, AC","Almqvist, Catarina|Class, Quetzal A.|D'Onofrio, Brian M.|Larsson, Henrik|Lichtenstein, Paul|Oberg, Anna S.|Rickert, Martin|Sujan, Ayesha C.",1159,-1,,,,,,,-1,,-1,,,,,,,,Article,10.1093/ije/dyy042,,,,1168,Clarivate Analytics Web of Science,,,,,,0300-5771,4,,,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY,,,,AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDERS|MATERNAL SMOKING|MENTAL-HEALTH|PREGNANCY INTERVAL|BIPOLAR DISORDER|BIRTH INTERVALS|VIOLENT CRIME|RISK-FACTORS|SCHIZOPHRENIA|INFECTION,-1,,pregnancy interval|birth spacing|psychopathology|case-comparison studies|interpregnancy interval,,AUG,J,2018,,,,,,"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health",,-1,,"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health",,0,Outcome-dependent associations between short interpregnancy interval and offspring psychological and educational problems: a population-based quasi-experimental study,0,,WOS:000444559900026,1,47,1464-3685,29566153,C:\Users\mginda\Desktop\agc1\wos-extract.isi,"Class QA, 2018, V47, P1159, DOI 10.1093/ije/dyy042"

"Background By the traditional definition of unintended weight loss, cachexia develops in similar to 80% of patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Here, we measure the longitudinal body composition changes in patients with advanced PDAC undergoing 5-fluorouracil, leucovorin, irinotecan, and oxaliplatin therapy. Methods We performed a retrospective review of 53 patients with advanced PDAC on 5-fluorouracil, leucovorin, irinotecan, and oxaliplatin as first line therapy at Indiana University Hospital from July 2010 to August 2015. Demographic, clinical, and survival data were collected. Body composition measurement by computed tomography (CT), trend, univariate, and multivariate analysis were performed. Results Among all patients, three cachexia phenotypes were identified. The majority of patients, 64%, had Muscle and Fat Wasting (MFW), while 17% had Fat-Only Wasting (FW) and 19% had No Wasting (NW). NW had significantly improved overall median survival (OMS) of 22.6months vs. 13.0months for FW and 12.2months for MFW (P = 0.02). FW (HR = 5.2; 95% confidence interval = 1.5-17.3) and MFW (HR = 1.8; 95% confidence interval = 1.1-2.9) were associated with an increased risk of mortality compared with NW. OMS and risk of mortality did not differ between FW and MFW. Progression of disease, sarcopenic obesity at diagnosis, and primary tail tumours were also associated with decreased OMS. On multivariate analysis, cachexia phenotype and chemotherapy response were independently associated with survival. Notably, CT-based body composition analysis detected tissue loss of >5% in 81% of patients, while the traditional definition of >5% body weight loss identified 56.6%. Conclusions Distinct cachexia phenotypes were observed in this homogeneous population of patients with equivalent stage, diagnosis, and first-line treatment. This suggests cellular, molecular, or genetic heterogeneity of host or tumour. Survival among patients with FW was as poor as for MFW, indicating adipose tissue plays a crucial role in cachexia and PDAC mortality. Adipose tissue should be studied for its mechanistic contributions to cachexia.",,,"Bell, TM|Couch, ME|Kays, JK|Kohli, MD|Koniaris, LG|O'Neill, BH|Shahda, S|Stanley, M|Zimmers, TA","Bell, Teresa M.|Couch, Marion E.|Kays, Joshua K.|Kohli, Marc D.|Koniaris, Leonidas G.|O'Neill, Bert H.|Shahda, Safi|Stanley, Melissa|Zimmers, Teresa A.",673,-1,,,,,,,-1,,-1,,,,,,,,Article,10.1002/jcsm.12307,,,,684,Clarivate Analytics Web of Science,,,,,,2190-6009,4,,,JOURNAL OF CACHEXIA SARCOPENIA AND MUSCLE,,,,SKELETAL-MUSCLE|ADIPOSE-TISSUE|LUNG-CANCER|WEIGHT-LOSS|ADENOCARCINOMA|CHEMOTHERAPY|OBESITY|INHIBITION|PREVALENCE|SARCOPENIA,-1,,Cachexia|Pancreatic cancer|Sarcopenia|FOLFIRINOX|Muscle wasting,,AUG,J,2018,,,,,,"Geriatrics & Gerontology|Medicine, General & Internal",,-1,,Geriatrics & Gerontology; General & Internal Medicine,,0,Three cachexia phenotypes and the impact of fat-only loss on survival in FOLFIRINOX therapy for pancreatic cancer,0,,WOS:000442345000006,1,9,,29978562,C:\Users\mginda\Desktop\agc1\wos-extract.isi,"Kays JK, 2018, V9, P673, DOI 10.1002/jcsm.12307"
"Background Concerns about teratogenicity and maternal and offspring complications restrict the use of lithium during pregnancy for the treatment of mood disorders. We aimed to investigate the association between in-utero lithium exposure and risk of pregnancy complications, delivery outcomes, neonatal morbidity, and congenital malformations. Methods In this meta-analysis, primary data from pregnant women and their children from six international cohorts based in the community (Denmark, Sweden, and Ontario, Canada) and in clinics (the Netherlands, UK, and USA) were analysed. Pregnancies were eligible for analysis if the pregnancy resulted in a liveborn singleton between 1997 and 2015, if health-related information was available for both mother and infant, and if the mother had a mood disorder (bipolar disorder or major depressive disorder) or if she had been given lithium during pregnancy (at least two dispensations of lithium during pregnancy that were dispensed any time from 1 month before conception until the delivery, or a single lithium dispensation during pregnancy when there was at least one other lithium dispensation within 6 months before or after this date). Pregnancies during which the mother had been prescribed known teratogenic drugs were excluded. Pregnancies were grouped into a lithium-exposed group and a mood disorder reference group. The main outcome measures were pregnancy complications, delivery outcomes, neonatal readmission to hospital within 28 days of birth, and congenital malformations (major malformations and major cardiac malformations). Analyses were done at each site by use of a shared protocol. Adjusted odds ratios (aORs) and 95% CIs were calculated by use of logistic regression models, and site-specific prevalence rates and ORs were pooled by use of random-effects meta-analytical models. Findings 22124 eligible pregnancies were identified across the six cohorts, of which 727 pregnancies were eligible for inclusion in the lithium-exposed group (557 [77%] from register-based cohorts and 170 [23%] from clinical cohorts). Lithium exposure was not associated with any of the predefined pregnancy complications or delivery outcomes. An increased risk for neonatal readmission within 28 days of birth was seen in the lithium-exposed group compared with the reference group (pooled prevalence 27.5% [95% CI 15.8-39.1] vs 14.3% [10. 4-18. 2]; pooled aOR 1.62, 95% CI 1.12-2.33). Lithium exposure during the first trimester was associated with an increased risk of major malformations (pooled prevalence 7.4% [95% CI 4. 0-10. 7] vs 4.3% [3.7-4.8]; pooled aOR 1.71, 95% CI 1.07-2.72) but for major cardiac malformations the difference was not significant (2.1% [0.5-3.7] vs 1.6% [1.0-2.1]; pooled aOR 1.54, 95% CI 0.64-3.70). Interpretation Considering both the effect sizes and the precision of the estimates in this meta-analysis, treatment decisions for pregnant women with mood disorders must weigh the potential for increased risks of lithium during pregnancy-in particular those associated with use of lithium during the first trimester-against its effectiveness at reducing relapse.",,,"Bergink, V|Brown, HK|Di Florio, A|D'Onofrio, BM|Gomes, T|Howard, LM|Khalifeh, H|Krohn, H|Larsson, H|Lichtenstein, P|Liu, XQ|Meltzer-Brody, S|Munk-Olsen, T|Taylor, CL|Van Kamp, I|Vigod, SN|Viktorin, A|Wesseloo, R","Bergink, Veerle|Brown, Hilary K.|Di Florio, Arianna|D'Onofrio, Brian M.|Gomes, Tara|Howard, Louise M.|Khalifeh, Hind|Krohn, Holly|Larsson, Henrik|Lichtenstein, Paul|Liu, Xiaoqin|Meltzer-Brody, Samantha|Munk-Olsen, Trine|Taylor, Clare L.|Van Kamp, Inge|Vigod, Simone N.|Viktorin, Alexander|Wesseloo, Richard",644,-1,,,,,,,-1,,-1,,,,,,,,Article,10.1016/S2215-0366(18)30180-9,,,,652,Clarivate Analytics Web of Science,,,,,,2215-0374,8,,,LANCET PSYCHIATRY,,,,IN-UTERO EXPOSURE|BIPOLAR DISORDER|RISK|MALFORMATIONS|TOXICITY|WOMEN,-1,"Viktorin, Alexander/0000-0003-2141-2816; Howard, Louise/0000-0001-9942-744X; Taylor, Clare/0000-0002-6181-1400; Munk-Olsen, Trine/0000-0002-0786-7147",,,AUG,J,2018,,,,,,Psychiatry,,-1,,Psychiatry,,0,Maternal and infant outcomes associated with lithium use in pregnancy: an international collaborative meta-analysis of six cohort studies,0,,WOS:000440070600023,1,5,,29929874,C:\Users\mginda\Desktop\agc1\wos-extract.isi,"Munk-Olsen T, 2018, V5, P644, DOI 10.1016/S2215-0366(18)30180-9"
"Objective To examine how provider report of confidential consultation in the electronic health record is associated with adolescent characteristics, health risk factors, and provider training. Study design This prospective cohort study was conducted as part of a larger study implementing computerized clinical decision support in 2 urban primary care clinics. Adolescents used tablets to complete screening questions for specified risk factors in the waiting room. Adolescent-reported risk factors included sexual activity, substance use, and depressive symptoms. Providers were prompted on encounter forms to address identified risk factors and indicate whether confidential consultation was provided. Provider types included adolescent medicine board certified pediatrics and general pediatrics. Differences in proportions of adolescents reporting risk factors by provider type were assessed using chi(2) tests. Associations between adolescent characteristics, risk factors, and provider-reported confidential consultation were examined using logistic regression analyses. Results The sample included 1233 English and Spanish-speaking adolescents 12-20 years of age (52% female; 60% black; 50% early adolescent). Patients seen by adolescent medicine board certified providers reported sexual activity. depressive symptoms, and substance use significantly more often than those seen by general pediatric providers. Among patients seen by board certified adolescent medicine providers, confidential consultation was provided to 90%.

"Aims To inform research on the etiology and prevention of substance use among rural African American youth by (a) identifying developmental trajectory classes of cannabis use and heavy drinking across adolescence and young adulthood and (b) examining associations between trajectory class membership and multi-level assessments of risk factors. Design A prospective study spanning 9 years with assessments of cannabis use and heavy drinking, the catecholamines epinephrine and norepinephrine, perceived stress and psychosocial risk factors. Setting Rural communities in the southeastern United States. Participants African American youth (n=518). Measurements Participants were assessed for cannabis use and heavy drinking at seven assessments beginning at 16 years of age and continuing to 25 years of age. At age 19, participants provided overnight urine voids that were assayed for catecholamines, a biological marker of life stress resulting from sympathetic nervous system activation. At ages 16 and 19, participants provided information on malleable psychosocial risk factors. Findings Latent class growth models revealed three distinct trajectory classes for cannabis use and for heavy drinking. Higher levels of circulating stress hormones and perceived stress were associated with classes reporting greater substance use over time (all Ps<0.05). A composite of selected risk factors discriminated class membership (all Ps<0.05). Trajectory classes characterized by rapid usage increases in early adulthood exhibited the greatest increase in deviant peer affiliations between ages 16 and 19 years. Conclusions Rural African American youth's cannabis use and heavy drinking across adolescence and young adulthood demonstrate distinct developmental courses; a small number of risk factors and measures of biological and perceived stress differentiate class membership prognostically. Variability over time in these measures, specifically an increase in deviant peer affiliation, may help to account for steep increases in young adulthood.",,,"Barton, AW|Brody, GH|Goings, TC|Kogan, SM|Windle, M|Yu, TY|Zapolski, TCB","Barton, Allen W.|Brody, Gene H.|Goings, Trenette C.|Kogan, Steven M.|Windle, Michael|Yu, Tianyi|Zapolski, Tamika C.

"Juvenile justice-involved youth face disproportionate rates of sexual abuse, which increases the risk of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and substance use disorders (SUDs), both of which are associated with poor long-term outcomes. The present study tested two mediation and moderation models, controlling for age, race, and history of physical abuse, with gender as a moderator, to determine whether PTSD symptoms serve as a risk factor and/or mechanism in the relationship between sexual abuse and substance use. Data were examined for 197 juvenile justice-involved youth (mean age = 15.45, 68.9% non-White, 78.4% male) that completed court-ordered psychological assessments. Results indicated that PTSD symptoms significantly mediated the relationship between sexual abuse and drug ( = 3.44, confidence interval [CI] [0.26, 7.41]; test for indirect effect z = 2.41, p = .02) and alcohol use ( = 1.42, CI [0.20, 3.46]; test for indirect effect z = 2.23, p = .03). PTSD symptoms and gender were not significant moderators. Overall, PTSD symptoms mediate the relationship between sexual abuse and SUDs in juvenile justice-involved youth, which suggests viability of targeting PTSD symptoms as a modifiable risk factor to reduce the effects of sexual abuse on substance use in this high-risk population.",,,"Aalsma, MC|Cyders, MA|Hershberger, AR|Kolp, HM|Sanders, J|Um, M","Aalsma, Matthew C.|Cyders, Melissa A.|Hershberger, Alexandra R.|Kolp, Haley M.|Sanders, Jasmyn|Um, Miji",226,-1,,,,,,,-1,,-1,,,,,,,,Article,10.1177/1077559517745154,,,,233,Clarivate Analytics Web of Science,,,,,,1077-5595,3,,,CHILD MALTREATMENT,,,,POSTTRAUMATIC-STRESS-DISORDER|PSYCHIATRIC-DISORDERS|ADOLESCENT GIRLS|GENDER-DIFFERENCES|MENTAL-DISORDERS|TRAUMA|VICTIMIZATION|DETENTION|IMPACT|COMORBIDITY,-1,,sexual abuse|substance use|PTSD|youth|juvenile justice,,AUG,J,2018,,,,,,Family Studies|Social Work,,-1,,Family Studies; Social Work,,1,PTSD Symptoms Mediate the Relationship Between Sexual Abuse and Substance Use Risk in Juvenile Justice-Involved Youth,1,,WOS:000438060100003,1,23,1552-6119,29232969,C:\Users\mginda\Desktop\agc1\wos-extract.isi,"Sanders J, 2018, V23, P226, DOI 10.1177/1077559517745154"

"The purpose of this study is to assess the impact of county-level variables on services offered to children who have guardia ad litem/court-appointed special advocate (GAL/CASA) representation. An email survey was sent to GALs and CASAs inviting them to participate in the study. A total of 473 GALs/CASAs completed the survey, with 437 meeting criteria for the study. Our sample represents 33 of 92 Indiana counties. We found the number and types of services ordered were strongly influenced by county contextual characteristics. Families served by a GAL/CASA in urban counties with more poverty received more services. In contrast, families with a GAL/CASA residing in counties with a greater percentage of minorities generated fewer services. Future research should focus on why environmental conditions influence GAL/CASA recommendations for services. Lastly, the relationship between the GAL/CASA race and the race of the families they serve should be explored.",,,"Aalsma, MC|Beerbower, E|Hall, JA|Jaggers, JW|Kondrat, D","Aalsma, Matthew C.|Beerbower, Emily|Hall, James A.|Jaggers, Jeremiah W.|Kondrat, David",244,-1,,,,,,,-1,,-1,,,,,,,,Article,10.1177/1044389418784963,,,,255,Clarivate Analytics Web of Science,,,,,,1044-3894,3,,,FAMILIES IN SOCIETY-THE JOURNAL OF CONTEMPORARY SOCIAL SERVICES,,,,MENTAL-HEALTH-SERVICES|CHILD-WELFARE|FOSTER-CARE|DECISION-MAKING|MISSING DATA|OUTCOMES|MALTREATMENT|INVOLVEMENT|PROTECTION|FAMILIES,-1,,child welfare|contextual factors|guardian ad litem,,JUL-SEP,J,2018,,,,,,Family Studies|Social Work,,-1,,Family Studies; Social Work,,0,Contextual Factors Influencing Recommendations for Service Provision by Guardia ad litem and Court-Appointed Special Advocates,0,,WOS:000441280300006,1,99,1945-1350,,C:\Users\mginda\Desktop\agc1\wos-extract.isi,"Jaggers JW, 2018, V99, P244, DOI 10.1177/1044389418784963"
"Background: While naloxone, the overdose reversal medication, has been available for decades, factors associated with its availability through pharmacies remain unclear. Studies suggest that policy and pharmacist beliefs may impact availability. Indiana passed a standing order law for naloxone in 2015 to increase access to naloxone. Objective: To identify factors associated with community pharmacy naloxone stocking and dispensing following the enactment of a statewide naloxone standing order. Methods: A 2016 cross-sectional census of Indiana community pharmacists was conducted following a naloxone standing order. Community, pharmacy, and pharmacist characteristics, and pharmacist attitudes about naloxone dispensing, access, and perceptions of the standing order were measured. Modified Poisson and binary logistic regression models attempted to predict naloxone stocking and dispensing, respectively. Results: Over half (58.1%) of pharmacies stocked naloxone, yet 23.6% of pharmacists dispensed it. Most (72.5%) pharmacists believed the standing order would increase naloxone stocking, and 66.5% believed it would increase dispensing. Chain pharmacies were 3.2 times as likely to stock naloxone. Naloxone stocking was 1.6 times as likely in pharmacies with more than one full-time pharmacist. Pharmacies where pharmacists received naloxone continuing education in the past two years were 1.3 times as likely to stock naloxone. The attempted dispensing model yielded no improvement over the constant-only model. Conclusions: Pharmacies with larger capacity took advantage of the naloxone standing order. Predictors of pharmacist naloxone dispensing should continue to be explored to maximize naloxone access.",,,"Agley, JD|Davis, A|Gassman, RA|Hoss, A|Jayawardene, W|Meyerson, BE|Ritchie, K|Ryder, PT|Shannon, DJ","Agley, Jon D.|Davis, Alissa|Gassman, Ruth A.|Hoss, A.|Jayawardene, W.|Meyerson, Beth E.|Ritchie, Karleen|Ryder, Priscilla T.|Shannon, David J.",187,-1,,,,,,,-1,,-1,,,,,,,,Article,10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2018.03.032,,,,192,Clarivate Analytics Web of Science,,,,,,0376-8716,,,,DRUG AND ALCOHOL DEPENDENCE,,,,OPIOID OVERDOSE PREVENTION|INJECTION-DRUG USERS|PERSPECTIVES|STRATEGIES|SETTINGS|INCREASE|DEATHS|RISKS|MODEL|STAFF,-1,,Naloxone access|Opioid overdose reversal|Pharmacy practice|Public health law,,1-Jul,J,2018,,,,,,Substance Abuse|Psychiatry,,-1,,Substance Abuse; Psychiatry,,0,"Predicting pharmacy naloxone stocking and dispensing following a statewide standing order, Indiana 2016",0,,WOS:000436912700027,1,188,1879-0046,29778772,C:\Users\mginda\Desktop\agc1\wos-extract.isi,"Meyerson BE, 2018, V188, P187, DOI 10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2018.03.032"
"Changes in the organization of medical practice have impeded humanistic practice and resulted in widespread physician burnout and dissatisfaction. To identify organizational factors that promote or inhibit humanistic practice of medicine by faculty physicians. From January 1, 2015, through December 31, 2016, faculty from eight US medical schools were asked to write reflectively on two open-ended questions regarding institutional-level motivators and impediments to humanistic practice and teaching within their organizations. Sixty eight of the 92 (74%) study participants who received the survey provided written responses. All subjects who were sent the survey had participated in a year-long small-group faculty development program to enhance humanistic practice and teaching. As humanistic leaders, subjects should have insights into motivating and inhibiting factors. Participants' responses were analyzed using the constant comparative method. Motivators included an organizational culture that enhances humanism, which we judged to be the overarching theme. Related themes included leadership supportive of humanistic practice, responsibility to role model humanism, organized activities that promote humanism, and practice structures that facilitate humanism. Impediments included top down organizational culture that inhibits humanism, along with related themes of non-supportive leadership, time and bureaucratic pressures, and non-facilitative practice structures. While healthcare has evolved rapidly, efforts to counteract the negative effects of changes in organizational and practice environments have largely focused on cultivating humanistic attributes in individuals. Our findings suggest that change at the organizational level is at least equally important. Physicians in our study described the characteristics of an organizational culture that supports and embraces humanism. We offer suggestions for organizational change that keep humanistic and compassionate patient care as its central focus.",,,"Branch, WT|Derse, AR|Dunne, DW|Frankel, RM|Gilligan, MC|Hafler, JP|Litzelman, DK|May, NB|Osterberg, LG|Plews-Ogan, M|Rider, EA|Weil, AB","Branch, William T., Jr.|Derse, Arthur R.|Dunne, Dana W.|Frankel, Richard M.|Gilligan, MaryAnn C.|Hafler, Janet P.|Litzelman, Debra K.|May, Natalie B.|Osterberg, Lars G.|Plews-Ogan, Margaret|Rider, Elizabeth A.|Weil, Amy B.",1092,-1,,,,,,,-1,,-1,,,,,,,,Article,10.1007/s11606-018-4470-2,,,,1099,Clarivate Analytics Web of Science,,,,,,0884-8734,7,,,JOURNAL OF GENERAL INTERNAL MEDICINE,,,,LONGITUDINAL FACULTY-DEVELOPMENT|PHYSICIAN BURNOUT|HUMAN DIMENSIONS|HIDDEN CURRICULUM|JOB-SATISFACTION|VALUES|MEDICINE|PATIENT|PROFESSIONALISM|INTERVENTIONS,-1,,humanism|organizational culture|faculty development|burnout|leadership|values|compassionate healthcare,,JUL,J,2018,,,,,,"Health Care Sciences & Services|Medicine, General & Internal",,-1,,Health Care Sciences & Services; General & Internal Medicine,,0,Healthcare at the Crossroads: The Need to Shape an Organizational Culture of Humanistic Teaching and Practice,0,,WOS:000436297300027,1,33,1525-1497,29740787,C:\Users\mginda\Desktop\agc1\wos-extract.isi,"Rider EA, 2018, V33, P1092, DOI 10.1007/s11606-018-4470-2"

"Background: Evidence-based policy communication (EBPC) is an important, emerging focus in public health research. However, we have yet to understand public health workforce ability to develop and/or use it The study objective was to characterize capacity to develop and use EBPC and identify cooperative learning and development opportunities using the case of Human papillomavirus (HPV). Methods: Vygotsky's Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD) informed guided interviews with 27 advocates in Indiana from government, industry, research, state associations and individuals. Participants focused on HPV, cancer, women's health, school health and minority health. Results: Capacity to develop and use EBPC was reported to develop through cooperative learning opportunities on the job or in advocacy focused coalitions. Coalition learning appeared to translate across health topics. Notably, policy experience did not assure understanding or use of EBPC Conclusions: The ZPD framework can inform workforce EBPC interventions by focusing on actual development, potential development and factors for learning and development in the ZPD.

"Background: Pharmacies have much to contribute to the health of people who inject drugs (PWID) and to community efforts in HIV and hepatitis C (HCV) prevention through syringe access. However, little is known about what predicts pharmacy syringe sales without a prescription. Objective: To identify factors predicting pharmacy syringes sales to PWID. Methods: A hybrid staggered online survey of 298 Indiana community pharmacists occurred from July September 2016 measuring pharmacy policy, practice, and pharmacist perceptions about syringe sales to PWID. Separate bivariate logistical regressions were followed by multivariable logistic regression to predict pharmacy syringe sales and pharmacist comfort dispensing syringes to PWID. Results: Half (50.5%) of Indiana pharmacies sold syringes without a prescription to PWID. Pharmacy syringe sales was strongly associated with pharmacist supportive beliefs about syringe access by PWID and their comfort level selling syringes to PWID. Notably, pharmacies located in communities with high rates of opioid overdose mortality were 56% less likely to sell syringes without a prescription than those in communities with lower rates. Pharmacist comfort dispensing syringes was associated with being male, working at a pharmacy that sold syringes to PWID and one that stocked naloxone, having been asked about syringe access by medical providers, and agreement that PWID should be able to buy syringes without a prescription. Conclusions: As communities with high rates of opioid overdose mortality were less likely to have pharmacies that dispensed syringes to PWID, a concerted effort with these communities and their pharmacies should be made to understand opportunities to increase syringe access. Future studies should explore nuances between theoretical support for syringe access by PWID without a prescription and actual dispensing behaviors. Addressing potential policy conflicts and offering continuing education on non-prescription syringe distribution for pharmacists may improve comfort distributing syringes to PWID, and therefore increase pharmacy syringe sales.",,,"Agley, JD|Davis, A|Gassman, RA|Lawrence, CA|Meyerson, BE|Ritchie, K|Ryder, PT|Shannon, DJ","Agley, Jon D.|Davis, Alissa|Gassman, Ruth A.|Lawrence, Carrie A.|Meyerson, Beth E.|Ritchie, Karleen|Ryder, Priscilla T.|Shannon, David J.",46,-1,,,,,,,-1,,-1,,,,,,,,Article,10.1016/j.drugpo.2018.02.024,,,,53,Clarivate Analytics Web of Science,,,,,,0955-3959,,,,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DRUG POLICY,,,,STERILE SYRINGES|EXCHANGE POLICY|HIV PREVENTION|UNITED-STATES|IMPACT|PERSPECTIVES|HIV/AIDS|USERS|PHYSICIANS|INCREASES,-1,,Syringe access|Hepatitis C prevention|Pharmacy public health|HIV prevention,,JUN,J,2018,,,,,,Substance Abuse,,-1,,Substance Abuse,,0,"Predicting pharmacy syringe sales to people who inject drugs: Policy, practice and perceptions",0,,WOS:000436051400006,1,56,1873-4758,29558701,C:\Users\mginda\Desktop\agc1\wos-extract.isi,"Meyerson BE, 2018, V56, P46, DOI 10.1016/j.drugpo.2018.02.024"
"Africa has a disproportionate burden of cervical cancer. As a part of the strategic approaches to contain the disease, several African countries have developed cervical cancer prevention and control (CCPC) plans. Such plans can help to create policy and program enabling environments to reduce cervical cancer. To date, there has not been any review of these plans. Method: A scoping-review was conducted of African country-level plans available online between June-October 2016 to describe the existence and focus of cervical cancer planning using adapted measures from the Healthy Public Policy Model. Results: Less than one quarter of countries (22.2%, n=12) had plans available for analysis. Of these plans, 69.2% had expired. The majority of countries with any stated plan for cervical cancer had CCPC elements embedded in other disease-focused plans. Five plans framed cervical cancer as cancer, and rest as the outcome of human papillomavirus (HPV), which is sexually transmitted. All plans emphasized survivorship more than early HPV diagnosis and prevention. Planned interventions targeted only women and girls. Rudimentary monitoring and evaluation (M&E) systems, and lack of integration of cervical cancer M&E with national health management information systems and cancer registries were shared issues. Plans reflected a top-down framing of community as beneficiary rather than an equal partner to technical experts in plan formulation and evaluation. Conclusion: A comprehensive picture of African CCPC efforts will require engagement with Ministry of Health (MoH) in each country. Extant evidence suggests that lack of resources is a major barriers to plan development and deployment.",,,"Agley, JD|Dutta, T|Meyerson, BE","Agley, Jon D.|Dutta, Tapati|Meyerson, Beth E.",73,-1,,,,,,,-1,,-1,,,,,,,,Review,10.1016/j.jcpo.2018.05.002,,,,81,Clarivate Analytics Web of Science,,,,,,2213-5383,,,,JOURNAL OF CANCER POLICY,,,,PUBLIC-HEALTH|DEVELOPING-COUNTRIES|HPV VACCINE|POLICY|PERSPECTIVE|CHALLENGES|FUTURE|CARE,-1,,Cervical cancer|HPV infection|Promotion of health|Monitoring and evaluation|Primary and secondary prevention|Community involvement,,JUN,J,2018,,,,,,Health Policy & Services,,-1,,Health Care Sciences & Services,,0,African cervical cancer prevention and control plans: A scoping review,0,,WOS:000434327900013,1,16,,,C:\Users\mginda\Desktop\agc1\wos-extract.isi,"Dutta T, 2018, V16, P73, DOI 10.1016/j.jcpo.2018.05.002"

Also, SCCS total scores were significantly related with favorable PES total scores (SCCS score difference of 0.26 between favorable and unfavorable PES scores, SE = .08, p = .002) controlling for other covariates. Non-White respondents (vs. White) demonstrated a positive association with SCCS total scores (difference of .18, SE = .07, p = .010), but not in advanced counseling. Linking Evidence to ActionNurse practice environments are positively associated with the use of evidence-based smoking cessation practices by nurses. As practice environments become more favorable, higher level counseling practices occur more often. Healthcare leaders should focus on enhancing the practice environment using a quality improvement approach and framework for evidence translation. Quality improvement initiatives should be prioritized in which high-quality evidence is available to support nursing processes.",,,"Byon, HD|Johantgen, M|Newhouse, RP|Wolf, ES","Byon, Ha Do|Johantgen, Meg|Newhouse, Robin P.|Wolf, Emily Storkman",217,-1,,,,,,,-1,,-1,,,,,,,,Article,10.1111/wvn.12277,,,,224,Clarivate Analytics Web of Science,,,,,,1545-102X,3,,,WORLDVIEWS ON EVIDENCE-BASED NURSING,,,,NURSING WORK INDEX|SCALE|HOSPITALS|MORTALITY|OUTCOMES,-1,,evidence-based practice|nursing practice|smoking cessation|tobacco use cessation|work environment|working conditions|substance use|substance abuse|alcohol use|tobacco use|drug abuse|health behaviors,,JUN,J,2018,,,,,,Nursing,,-1,,Nursing,,0,Multisite Studies Demonstrate Positive Relationship Between Practice Environments and Smoking Cessation Counseling Evidence-Based Practices,0,,WOS:000434420500008,1,15,1741-6787,29528194,C:\Users\mginda\Desktop\agc1\wos-extract.isi,"Newhouse R, 2018, V15, P217, DOI 10.1111/wvn.12277"
"Health information technology is a core infrastructure for the chronic care model, integrated care, and other organized care delivery models. From the provider perspective, health information exchange (HIE) helps aggregate and share information about a patient or population from several sources. HIE technologies include direct messages, transfer of care, and event notification services. From the patient perspective, personal health records, secure messaging, text messages, and other mHealth applications may coordinate patients and providers. Patient-reported outcomes and social media technologies enable patients to share health information with many stake-holders, including providers, caregivers, and other patients. An information architecture that integrates personal health record and mHealth applications, with HIEs that combine the electronic health records of multiple healthcare systems will create a rich, dynamic ecosystem for patient collaboration.",,,"Dixon, BE|Embi, PJ|Haggstrom, DA","Dixon, Brian E.|Embi, Peter J.|Haggstrom, David A.",522,-1,,,,,,,-1,,-1,,,,,,,,Editorial Material,10.1093/tbm/ibx086,,,,525,Clarivate Analytics Web of Science,,,,,,1869-6716,3,,,TRANSLATIONAL BEHAVIORAL MEDICINE,,,,ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORD|VETERANS|ADOPTION|OUTCOMES,-1,"Dixon, Brian/0000-0002-1121-0607",Informatics|Public health,,JUN,J,2018,,,,,,"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health",,-1,SI,"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health",,0,Information technologies that facilitate care coordination: provider and patient perspectives,0,,WOS:000433218200023,1,8,1613-9860,29800411,C:\Users\mginda\Desktop\agc1\wos-extract.isi,"Dixon BE, 2018, V8, P522, DOI 10.1093/tbm/ibx086"
"Background: In response to widespread opioid misuse, ten U.S. states have implemented regulations for facilities that primarily manage and treat chronic pain, called ""pain clinics."" Whether a clinic falls into a state's pain clinic definition determines the extent to which it is subject to oversight. It is unclear whether state pain clinic definitions model those found in the medical literature, and potential differences lead to discrepancies between scientific and professionally guided advice found in the medical literature and actual pain clinic practice. Identifying discrepancies could assist states to design laws that are more compatible with best practices suggested in the medical literature. Methods: We conducted an integrative systematic review to create a taxonomy of pain clinic definitions using academic medical literature. We then identified existing U.S. state pain clinic statutes and regulations and compared the developed taxonomy using a content analysis approach to understand the extent to which medical literature definitions are reflected in state policy. Results: In the medical literature, we identified eight categories of pain clinic definitions: 1) patient case mix; 2) single-modality treatment; 3) multidisciplinary treatment; 4) interdisciplinary treatment; 5) provider supervision; 6) provider composition; 7) marketing; and 8) outcome. We identified ten states with pain clinic laws. State laws primarily include the following definitional categories: patient case mix; single-modality treatment, and marketing. Some definitional categories commonly found in the medical literature, such as multidisciplinary treatment and interdisciplinary treatment, rarely appear in state law definitions. Conclusions: This is the first study to our knowledge to develop a taxonomy of pain clinic definitions and to identify differences between pain clinic definitions in U.S. state law and medical literature. Future work should explore the impact of different legal pain clinic definitions on provider decision-making and state-level health outcomes.",,,"Andraka-Christou, B|Brown-Podgorski, B|Rager, JB|Silverman, RD|Watson, DP","Andraka-Christou, Barbara|Brown-Podgorski, Brittany|Rager, Joshua B.|Silverman, Ross D.|Watson, Dennis P.",,-1,,,,,,,-1,,-1,,,,,,,,Review,10.1186/s13011-018-0153-6,,,,,Clarivate Analytics Web of Science,,,,,,1747-597X,,,,SUBSTANCE ABUSE TREATMENT PREVENTION AND POLICY,,,17,TREATMENT FACILITIES|MULTIDISCIPLINARY|CANADA|MANAGEMENT|BACK,-1,,Pain clinic|Pain treatment|opioid|state policy|Integrative review|Systematic review|Content analysis,,22-May,J,2018,,,,,,Substance Abuse,,-1,,Substance Abuse,,1,Pain clinic definitions in the medical literature and US state laws: an integrative systematic review and comparison,1,,WOS:000433116300001,1,13,,29789018,C:\Users\mginda\Desktop\agc1\wos-extract.isi,"Andraka-Christou B, 2018, V13, DOI 10.1186/s13011-018-0153-6"
"Professional society membership enhances career development and productivity by offering opportunities for networking and learning about recent advances in the field. The quality and contribution of such societies can be measured in part through the academic productivity, career status, and funding success rates of their members. Here, using Scopus, NIH RePORTER, and departmental websites, we compare characteristics of the Shock Society membership to those of the top 55 NIH-funded American university and hospital-based departments of surgery. Shock Society members' mean number of publications, citations and H-indices were all significantly higher than those of non-members in surgery departments (P<0.001). A higher percentage of members also have received funding from the NIH (42.5% vs. 18.5%, P<0.001). Regression analysis indicated that members were more likely to have NIH funding compared with non-members (OR 1.46, 95% CI 1.12-1.916). Trauma surgeons belonging to the Shock Society had a higher number of publications and greater NIH funding than those who did not (130.4 vs. 42.7, P<0.001; 40.4% vs. 8.5%, P<0.001). Aggregate academic metrics from the Shock Society were superior to those of the Association for Academic Surgery and generally for the Society of University Surgeons as well. These data indicate that the Shock Society represents a highly academic and productive group of investigators. For surgery faculty, membership is associated with greater academic productivity and career advancement. While it is difficult to ascribe causation, certainly the Shock Society might positively influence careers for its members.",,,"Bell, TM|Koniaris, LG|Lad, N|Milgrom, DP|Valsangkar, NP|Wojcik, B|Zimmers, TA","Bell, Teresa M.|Koniaris, Leonidas G.|Lad, Neha|Milgrom, Daniel P.|Valsangkar, Nakul P.|Wojcik, Brandon|Zimmers, Teresa A.",508,-1,,,,,,,-1,,-1,,,,,,,,Article,10.1097/SHK.0000000000001049,,,,513,Clarivate Analytics Web of Science,,,,,,1073-2322,5,,,SHOCK,,,,CLINICIAN-EDUCATORS|PROMOTION CRITERIA|SURGERY|TRAUMA|PRODUCTIVITY|ASSOCIATION|DEPARTMENTS|FACULTY|DISEASE|FUTURE,-1,,Academic productivity|citations|H-index|NIH funding|trauma surgery,,MAY,J,2018,,,,,,Critical Care Medicine|Hematology|Surgery|Peripheral Vascular Disease,,-1,,General & Internal Medicine; Hematology; Surgery; Cardiovascular System & Cardiology,,1,AN ASSESSMENT OF THE ACADEMIC IMPACT OF SHOCK SOCIETY MEMBERS,1,,WOS:000441342500004,1,49,1540-0514,29112102,C:\Users\mginda\Desktop\agc1\wos-extract.isi,"Milgrom DP, 2018, V49, P508, DOI 10.1097/SHK.0000000000001049"

"Objective: To develop an empirically derived taxonomy of clinical decision support (CDS) alert malfunctions. Materials and Methods: We identified CDS alert malfunctions using a mix of qualitative and quantitative methods: (1) site visits with interviews of chief medical informatics officers, CDS developers, clinical leaders, and CDS end users; (2) surveys of chief medical informatics officers; (3) analysis of CDS firing rates; and (4) analysis of CDS overrides. We used a multi-round, manual, iterative card sort to develop a multi-axial, empirically derived taxonomy of CDS malfunctions. Results: We analyzed 68 CDS alert malfunction cases from 14 sites across the United States with diverse electronic health record systems. Four primary axes emerged: the cause of the malfunction, its mode of discovery, when it began, and how it affected rule firing. Build errors, conceptualization errors, and the introduction of new concepts or terms were the most frequent causes. User reports were the predominant mode of discovery. Many malfunctions within our database caused rules to fire for patients for whom they should not have (false positives), but the reverse (false negatives) was also common. Discussion: Across organizations and electronic health record systems, similar malfunction patterns recurred. Challenges included updates to code sets and values, software issues at the time of system upgrades, difficulties with migration of CDS content between computing environments, and the challenge of correctly conceptualizing and building CDS. Conclusion: CDS alert malfunctions are frequent. The empirically derived taxonomy formalizes the common recurring issues that cause these malfunctions, helping CDS developers anticipate and prevent CDS malfunctions before they occur or detect and resolve them expediently.",,,"Aaron, S|Ai, A|Ash, J|Bates, DW|Borkowsky, S|Dissanayake, PI|Embi, PJ|Galanter, W|Harper, J|Hickman, TTT|Kassakian, SZ|McEvoy, D|Ramoni, R|Schreiber, R|Sirajuddin, A|Sittig, DF|Wiesen, JF|Wright, A","Aaron, Skye|Ai, Angela|Ash, Joan|Bates, David W.|Borkowsky, Shane|Dissanayake, Pavithra I.|Embi, Peter J.|Galanter, William|Harper, Jeremy|Hickman, Thu-Trang T.|Kassakian, Steve Z.|McEvoy, Dustin|Ramoni, Rachel|Schreiber, Richard|Sirajuddin, Anwar|Sittig, Dean F.|Wiesen, Jane F.|Wright, Adam",496,-1,,,,,,,-1,,-1,,,,,,,,Article,10.1093/jamia/ocx106,,,,506,Clarivate Analytics Web of Science,,,,,,1067-5027,5,,,JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MEDICAL INFORMATICS ASSOCIATION,,,,PHYSICIAN ORDER ENTRY|HEALTH INFORMATION-TECHNOLOGY|SERVICE-ORIENTED ARCHITECTURE|MEANINGFUL USE|PATIENT OUTCOMES|PRACTITIONER PERFORMANCE|UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES|KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT|SYSTEMS|SAFETY,-1,,clinical decision support|electronic health records|safety|anomaly detection,,MAY,J,2018,,,,,,"Computer Science, Information Systems|Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications|Health Care Sciences & Services|Information Science & Library Science|Medical Informatics",,-1,,Computer Science; Health Care Sciences & Services; Information Science & Library Science; Medical Informatics,,3,Clinical decision support alert malfunctions: analysis and empirically derived taxonomy,3,,WOS:000434113200006,1,25,1527-974X,29045651,C:\Users\mginda\Desktop\agc1\wos-extract.isi,"Wright A, 2018, V25, P496, DOI 10.1093/jamia/ocx106"
"BACKGROUND: Asthma is associated with several adverse pregnancy and perinatal outcomes. Familial factors may confound these associations. OBJECTIVE: To examine the role of measured and unmeasured confounding by conducting a study that compared differentially exposed cousins and siblings from the same families. METHODS: We retrieved data on adverse pregnancy outcomes, prescribed drugs, and physician-diagnosed asthma from nationwide registers for all women in Sweden with singleton births between 2001 and 2013. Logistic and linear regression estimated the association between maternal asthma and several outcomes in the whole population and within differently exposed pregnant relatives. RESULTS: In total, 1,075,153 eligible pregnancies were included and 10.1% of the study population had asthma. We identified 475,200 cousin and 341,205 sister pregnancies. Women with asthma had increased risks for preeclampsia (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.17; 95% CI, 1.13-1.21), emergency cesarean section (aOR, 1.24; 95% CI, 1.22-1.27), and having a child small for gestational age (aOR, 1.18; 95% CI, 1.12-1.23). In the conditional regression analyses, after adjustment for familial factors, the associations remained: preeclampsia in cousins (aOR, 1.16; 95% CI, 1.07-1.25) and siblings (aOR, 1.23; 95% CI, 1.08-1.38), emergency cesarean section in cousins (aOR, 1.28) and siblings (aOR, 1.21), and small for gestational age in cousins (aOR, 1.17) and siblings (aOR, 1.13). CONCLUSIONS: Factors shared by siblings and cousins do not seem to explain the observed association between maternal asthma and adverse pregnancy outcomes. This implies that targeting the asthma disease will continue to be important in reducing risks for adverse outcomes in pregnancy. (C) 2017 The Authors.

"IMPORTANCE Adults with mental health conditions are more likely than those without to receive long-term opioid therapy. Less is known about opioid therapy among adolescents, especially those with mental health conditions. OBJECTIVE To examine associations between preexisting mental health conditions and treatments and initiation of any opioid and long-term opioid therapy among adolescents. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A cohort of 1 224 520 incident opioid recipients without cancer diagnoses aged 14 to 18 years at first receipt was extracted from nationwide commercial health care claims data from January 1, 2003, to December 31, 2014. Analysis was conducted from August 19, 2016, to November 16, 2017. Associations between preexisting mental health conditions and treatments and any opioid receipt were examined by comparing recipients with nonrecipients matched on sex, calendar year and years of age of first enrollment, and months of enrollment (prior to the index month for recipients, ever for nonrecipients). Associations between preexisting mental health conditions and treatments and subsequent long-term opioid therapy were examined among recipients with at least 6 months' follow-up using Cox proportional hazards regressions adjusted for demographics. EXPOSURES Mental health condition diagnoses and treatments recorded in inpatient, outpatient, and filled-prescription claims prior to opioid receipt. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Opioid receipt, defined as any opioid analgesic prescription claim, and long-term opioid therapy, defined as more than 90 days' supply within a 6-month window having no gaps in supply of more than 32 days. RESULTS Of the 1 224 520 new opioid recipients included, the median age at first receipt was 17 years (interquartile range, 16-18 years), and 51.1% were female. Median follow-up after first receipt was 625 days (interquartile range, 255-1268 days). Adolescents with anxiety, mood, neurodevelopmental, sleep, and nonopioid substance use disorders and most mental health treatments were significantly more likely to receive any opioid (odds ratios from 1.13 [95% CI, 1.10-1.16] for nonopioid substance use disorders to 1.69 [95% CI, 1.58-1.81] for nonbenzodiazepine hypnotics). Among the 1 000 453 opioid recipients (81.7%) who had at least 6 months' follow-up, the cumulative incidence of long-term opioid therapy was 3.0 (95% CI, 2.8-3.1) per 1000 recipients within 3 years after first opioid receipt. All preexisting mental health conditions and treatments were strongly associated with higher rates of long-term opioid therapy (adjusted hazard ratios from 1.73 [95% CI 1.54-1.95] for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder to 8.90 [95% CI, 5.85-13.54] for opioid use disorder). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Commercially insured adolescents with many types of preexisting mental health conditions and treatments were modestly more likely to receive any opioid and were substantially more likely to subsequently transition to long-term opioid therapy relative to those without, although overall rates of long-term opioid therapy were low.",,,"Bair, MJ|Chang, Z|D'Onofrio, BM|Gibbons, RD|Hur, K|Krebs, EE|Kroenke, K|Quinn, PD|Rickert, ME|Scott, EL","Bair, Matthew J.|Chang, Zheng|D'Onofrio, Brian M.|Gibbons, Robert D.|Hur, Kwan|Krebs, Erin E.|Kroenke, Kurt|Quinn, Patrick D.|Rickert, Martin|Scott, Eric L.",423,-1,,,,,,,-1,,-1,,,,,,,,Article,10.1001/jamapediatrics.2017.5641,,,,430,Clarivate Analytics Web of Science,,,,,,2168-6203,5,,,JAMA PEDIATRICS,,,,CHRONIC NONCANCER PAIN|UNITED-STATES|PRESCRIBING OPIOIDS|OVERDOSE DEATHS|CDC GUIDELINE|YOUNG-ADULTS|USE DISORDER|MISSING P|THERAPY|TRENDS,-1,"Quinn, Patrick/0000-0002-6770-8762",,,MAY,J,2018,,,,,,Pediatrics,,-1,,Pediatrics,,1,Association of Mental Health Conditions and Treatments With Long-term Opioid Analgesic Receipt Among Adolescents,1,,WOS:000431638900010,1,172,2168-6211,29532067,C:\Users\mginda\Desktop\agc1\wos-extract.isi,"Quinn PD, 2018, V172, P423, DOI 10.1001/jamapediatrics.2017.5641"
"Adverse perinatal events may increase the risk of Tourette's and chronic tic disorders (TD/CTD), but previous studies have been unable to control for unmeasured environmental and genetic confounding. We aimed to prospectively investigate potential perinatal risk factors for TD/CTD, taking unmeasured factors shared between full siblings into account. A population-based birth cohort, consisting of all singletons born in Sweden in 1973-2003, was followed until December 2013. A total of 3 026 861 individuals were identified, 5597 of which had a registered TD/CTD diagnosis. We then studied differentially exposed full siblings from 947 942 families; of these, 3563 families included siblings that were discordant for TD/CTD. Perinatal data were collected from the Medical Birth Register and TD/CTD diagnoses were collected from the National Patient Register, using a previously validated algorithm. In the fully adjusted models, impaired fetal growth, preterm birth, breech presentation and cesarean section were associated with a higher risk of TD/CTD, largely independent from shared family confounders and measured covariates. Maternal smoking during pregnancy was associated with risk of TD/CTD in a dose-response manner but the association was no longer statistically significant in the sibling comparison models or after the exclusion of comorbid attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. A dose-response relationship between the number of adverse perinatal events and increased risk for TD/CTD was also observed, with hazard ratios ranging from 1.41 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.33-1.50) for one event to 2.42 (95% CI: 1.65-3.53) for five or more events.

"Cannabis use is linked to positive and negative outcomes. Identifying genetic targets of susceptibility to the negative effects of cannabinoid use is of growing importance. The current study sought to complete short-term selective breeding for adolescent sensitivity and resistance to the locomotor effects of a single 10 mg/kg THC dose in the open field. Selection for THC-locomotor sensitivity was moderately heritable, with the greatest estimates of heritability seen in females from the F2 to S3 generations. Selection for locomotor sensitivity also resulted in increased anxiety-like activity in the open field. These results are the first to indicate that adolescent THC-locomotor sensitivity can be influenced via selective breeding. Development of lines with a genetic predisposition for THC-sensitivity or resistance to locomotor effects allow for investigation of risk factors, differences in consequences of THC use, identification of correlated behavioral responses, and detection of genetic targets that may contribute to heightened cannabinoid sensitivity.",,,"Boehm, SL|Kasten, CR|Mackie, K|Zhang, YP","Boehm, Stephen L., II|Kasten, Chelsea R.|Mackie, Ken|Zhang, Yanping",224,-1,,,,,,,-1,,-1,,,,,,,,Article,10.1007/s10519-018-9894-2,,,,235,Clarivate Analytics Web of Science,,,,,,0001-8244,3,,,BEHAVIOR GENETICS,,,,MEDICAL MARIJUANA LAWS|INBRED MOUSE STRAINS|SYNTHETIC CANNABINOIDS|SEX-DIFFERENCES|DRUG-ADDICTION|EXPOSURE|DELTA-9-TETRAHYDROCANNABINOL|EXPRESSION|BEHAVIOR|ANXIETY,-1,"Kasten, Chelsea/0000-0002-6502-1051",Adolescent|Cannabinoids|THC|Locomotion|Selection|Genetic,,MAY,J,2018,,,,,,"Behavioral Sciences|Genetics & Heredity|Psychology, Multidisciplinary",,-1,,Behavioral Sciences; Genetics & Heredity; Psychology,,0,Short-Term Genetic Selection for Adolescent Locomotor Sensitivity to Delta9-Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC),0,,WOS:000431414200005,1,48,1573-3297,29550900,C:\Users\mginda\Desktop\agc1\wos-extract.isi,"Kasten CR, 2018, V48, P224, DOI 10.1007/s10519-018-9894-2"
"Background: To reduce fatal drug overdoses, two approaches many states have followed is to pass laws expanding naloxone access and Good Samaritan protections for lay persons with high likelihood to respond to an opioid overdose. Most prior research has examined attitudes and knowledge among lay responders in large metropolitan areas who actively use illicit substances. The present study addresses current gaps in knowledge related to this issue through an analysis of data collected from a broader group of lay responders who received naloxone kits from 20 local health departments across Indiana. Methods: Postcard surveys were included inside naloxone kits distributed in 20 Indiana counties, for which 217 returned cards indicated the person completing it was a lay responder. The survey captured demographic information and experiences with overdose, including the use of 911 and knowledge about Good Samaritan protections. Results: Few respondents had administered naloxone before, but approximately one third had witnessed a prior overdose and the majority knew someone who had died from one. Those who knew someone who had overdosed were more likely to have obtained naloxone for someone other than themselves. Also, persons with knowledge of Good Samaritan protections or who had previously used naloxone were significantly more likely to have indicated calling 911 at the scene of a previously witnessed overdose. Primary reasons for not calling 911 included fear of the police and the person who overdosed waking up on their own. Conclusions: Knowing someone who has had a fatal or non-fatal overdose appears to be a strong motivating factor for obtaining naloxone. Clarifying and strengthening Good Samaritan protections, educating lay persons about these protections, and working to improve police interactions with the public when they are called to an overdose scene are likely to improve implementation and outcomes of naloxone distribution and opioid-related Good Samaritan laws.",,,"Brucker, K|Duwve, JM|Huynh, P|Ray, B|Robison, L|Sightes, E|Walker, L|Watson, DP","Brucker, Krista|Duwve, Joan M.|Huynh, Philip|Ray, Bradley|Robison, Lisa|Sightes, Emily|Walker, La Shea|Watson, Dennis P.",,-1,,,,,,,-1,,-1,,,,,,,,Article,10.1186/s12954-018-0226-x,,,,,Clarivate Analytics Web of Science,,,,,,1477-7517,,,,HARM REDUCTION JOURNAL,,,18,OPIOID OVERDOSE PREVENTION|INJECTION-DRUG USERS|EMERGENCY MEDICAL-SERVICES|INTRANASAL NALOXONE|HEROIN USERS|INTERVENTION|ATTITUDES|EXPERIENCES|MORTALITY|KNOWLEDGE,-1,,Naloxone|Narcan|Opioid|Overdose prevention|Lay responder|Good Samaritan,,6-Apr,J,2018,,,,,,Substance Abuse,,-1,,Substance Abuse,,0,Lay responder naloxone access and Good Samaritan law compliance: postcard survey results from 20 Indiana counties,0,,WOS:000429547700001,1,15,,29625609,C:\Users\mginda\Desktop\agc1\wos-extract.isi,"Watson DP, 2018, V15, DOI 10.1186/s12954-018-0226-x"
"Objective: To describe injection-related HIV risk behaviors preimplementation and postimplementation of an emergency syringe services program (SSP) in Scott County, Indiana, after an HIV outbreak among persons who inject drugs (PWID). Design: Mixed methods retrospective pre-post intervention analysis. Methods: We analyzed routine SSP program data collected at first and most recent visit among clients with >= 2 visits, >= 7 days apart from April 4 to August 30, 2015, to quantify changes in injection-related risk behaviors. We also analyzed qualitative data collected from 56 PWID recruited in Scott County to understand factors contributing to these behaviors. Results: SSP clients included in our analysis (n = 148, 62% of all SSP clients) reported significant (P < 0.001) reductions over a median 10 weeks (range 1-23) in syringe sharing to inject (18%-2%) and divide drugs (19%-4%), sharing other injection equipment (eg, cookers) (24%-5%), and number of uses of the same syringe [2 (interquartile range: 1-4) to 1 (interquartile range: 1-1)]. Qualitative study participants described access to sterile syringes and safer injection education through the SSP, as explanatory factors for these reductions. Injection frequency findings were mixed, but overall suggested no change. The number of syringes returned by SSP clients increased from 0 at first visit to median 57. All qualitative study participants reported using sharps containers provided by the SSP. Conclusions: Analyses of an SSP program and in-depth qualitative interview data showed rapid reduction of injection-related HIV risk behaviors among PWID post-SSP implementation. Sterile syringe access as part of comprehensive HIV prevention is an important tool to control and prevent HIV outbreaks.",,,"Brooks, JT|Broz, D|Chapman, EL|Combs, B|Duwve, JM|Foote, C|Fry, A|Hall, P|Patel, MR|Roseberry, JC","Brooks, John T.|Broz, Dita|Chapman, Erika L.|Combs, Brittany|Duwve, Joan M.|Foote, Carrie|Fry, Alexandra|Hall, Patti|Patel, Monita R.|Roseberry, Jeremy C.",373,-1,,,,,,,-1,,-1,,,,,,,,Article,10.1097/QAI.0000000000001615,,,,382,Clarivate Analytics Web of Science,,,,,,1525-4135,4,,,JAIDS-JOURNAL OF ACQUIRED IMMUNE DEFICIENCY SYNDROMES,,,,NEEDLE EXCHANGE PROGRAM|DRUG-USERS|HEPATITIS-C|UNITED-STATES|TRANSMISSION|INFECTION|INCREASES|ABSCESSES,-1,,syringe-exchange programs|outbreaks|HIV|risk behavior|syringe sharing|risk reduction behavior,,1-Apr,J,2018,,,,,,Immunology|Infectious Diseases,,-1,,Immunology; Infectious Diseases,,1,Reduction of Injection-Related Risk Behaviors After Emergency Implementation of a Syringe Services Program During an HIV Outbreak,1,,WOS:000444625400007,1,77,1077-9450,29271829,C:\Users\mginda\Desktop\agc1\wos-extract.isi,"Patel MR, 2018, V77, P373, DOI 10.1097/QAI.0000000000001615"

"Psychometrics of the Smoking Cessation Counseling Scale, which measures adherence to evidence-based smoking cessation counseling practice, were originally estimated among rural hospital nurses. The purpose of this study was to estimate the scale's reliability, convergent validity, and factor structure among 289 nurses from 27 acute care Magnet (R) hospitals. The scale demonstrated acceptable estimates for internal consistency (Cronbach's = .95, 95% CI = [0.94, 0.96]). Convergent validity was supported by the association with comfort in conducting smoking cessation counseling (coefficient = 3.58, 95% CI = [2.80, 4.37]) and shared vision (coefficient = 0.72, 95% CI = [0.02, 1.42]). A four-factor structure (standard care, basic counseling, advanced counseling, and referral to services) was identified.

"Although many juvenile offenders report experiencing police injustice, few studies have examined how this source of strain may impact youths' behavioral outcomes, including risk for future recidivism. This study begins to address that gap in the literature. We applied the general strain theory as our theoretical framework to examine the interactive effect of perceived police injustice and moral disengagement on juvenile aggressive behavior. Our sample included 95 juvenile offenders who completed questionnaires on measures of perceived police injustice and moral disengagement. Results supported our hypothesis, such that moral disengagement predicted past month aggression among juvenile offenders, but only by youth who reported mean and high levels of perceived police injustice. While more research is needed in this area, this study's findings underscore the need to address both perceived police engagement and moral disengagement among youth at-risk of engaging in delinquent behaviors.

"Objective Individuals with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are at increased risk of seizures, but there is uncertainty about whether ADHD medication treatment increases risk among patients with and without preexisting seizures. Methods We followed a sample of 801,838 patients with ADHD who had prescribed drug claims from the Truven Health MarketScan Commercial Claims and Encounters databases to examine whether ADHD medication increases the likelihood of seizures among ADHD patients with and without a history of seizures. First, we assessed overall risk of seizures among patients with ADHD. Second, within-individual concurrent analyses assessed odds of seizure events during months when a patient with ADHD received ADHD medication compared with when the same individual did not, while adjusting for antiepileptic medications. Third, within-individual long-term analyses examined odds of seizure events in relation to the duration of months over the previous 2 years patients received medication. Results Patients with ADHD were at higher odds for any seizure compared with non-ADHD controls (odds ratio [OR] = 2.33, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 2.24-2.42 males; OR = 2.31, 95% CI = 2.22-2.42 females). In adjusted within-individual comparisons, ADHD medication was associated with lower odds of seizures among patients with (OR = 0.71, 95% CI = 0.60-0.85) and without (OR = 0.71, 95% CI = 0.62-0.82) prior seizures. Long-term within-individual comparisons suggested no evidence of an association between medication use and seizures among individuals with (OR = 0.87, 95% CI = 0.59-1.30) and without (OR = 1.01, 95% CI = 0.80-1.28) a seizure history. Conclusions Results reaffirm that patients with ADHD are at higher risk of seizures. However, ADHD medication was associated with lower risk of seizures within individuals while they were dispensed medication, which is not consistent with the hypothesis that ADHD medication increases risk of seizures.",,,"Brikell, I|Chang, Z|D'Onofrio, BM|Dunn, DW|Gibbons, RD|Hur, K|Larsson, H|Quinn, PD|Wiggs, KK","Brikell, Isabell|Chang, Zheng|D'Onofrio, Brian M.|Dunn, David W.|Gibbons, Robert D.|Hur, Kwan|Larsson, Henrik|Quinn, Patrick D.|Wiggs, Kelsey K.",E1104,-1,,,,,,,-1,,-1,,,,,,,,Article,10.1212/WNL.0000000000005213,,,,+,Clarivate Analytics Web of Science,,,,,,0028-3878,13,,,NEUROLOGY,,,,DEFICIT-HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER|ADHD MEDICATION|EPILEPSY|METHYLPHENIDATE|CHILDREN|RISK|CHILDHOOD|ADOLESCENTS|MANAGEMENT,-1,"Brikell, Isabell/0000-0002-3800-6665",,,27-Mar,J,2018,,,,,,Clinical Neurology,,-1,,Neurosciences & Neurology,,1,Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder medication and seizures,1,,WOS:000439102000002,1,90,1526-632X,29476037,C:\Users\mginda\Desktop\agc1\wos-extract.isi,"Wiggs KK, 2018, V90, E1104, DOI 10.1212/WNL.0000000000005213"
"Objective: We tested a novel, web-based teaching electronic medical record to teach and assess residents' ability to enter appropriate admission orders for patients admitted to the intensive care unit. The primary objective was to determine if this tool could improve the learners' ability to enter an evidence-based, comprehensive initial care plan for critically ill patients. Methods: The authors created three modules using de-identifed real patient data from selected patients that were admitted to the intensive care unit. All senior residents (113 total) were invited to participate in a dedicated two-hour educational session to complete the modules. Learner performance was graded against gold standard admission order sets created by study investigators based on the latest evidence-based medicine and guidelines. Results: The session was attended by 39 residents (34.5% of invitees). There was an average improvement of at least 20% in users' scores across the three modules (Module 3-Module 1 mean difference 22.5%; p = 0.001 and Module 3-Module 2 mean difference 20.3%; p = 0.001). Diagnostic acumen improved in successive modules. Almost 90% of the residents reported the technology was an effective form of teaching and would use it autonomously if more modules were provided. Conclusions: In this pilot project, using a novel educational tool, users' patient care performance scores improved with a high level of user satisfaction. These results identify a realistic and well-received way to supplement residents' training and assessment on core clinical care and patient management in the face of duty hour restrictions.",,"Harow, Cory/N-4221-2018","Carlos, WG|Johnson, CS|Litzelman, DK|Smith, J|Takesue, B","Carlos, W.

"Objective To describe antiretroviral therapy (ART) adherence and associated factors for a large HIV-infected pediatric cohort followed by sites of the East Africa International Epidemiologic Databases to Evaluate AIDS (IeDEA) consortium. Methods This study utilized prospectively collected clinical data from HIV-infected children less than 13 years of age who initiated ART within 4 clinical care programs (with 26 clinical sites) in Kenya, Uganda, and Tanzania and were followed for up to 6 years. Programs used one of 3 adherence measures, including 7-day quantitative recall, 7-day categorical recall, and clinician pill assessments. We fit a hierarchical, three-level, logistic-regression model to examine adherence, with observations nested within patient, and patients within the 26 sites providing pediatric HIV data to this analysis. Results In East Africa, 3,304 children, 52.0% male, were enrolled in care and were subsequently observed for a median of 92 weeks (inter-quartile range [IQR] 50.3-145.0 weeks). Median age at ART initiation was 5.5 years ([IQR] 3.0-8.5 years). ""Good"" adherence, as reported by each clinic's measures, was extremely high, remaining on average above 90% throughout all years of follow-up. Longer time on ART was associated with higher adherence (adjusted Odds Ratio-aOR-per log-transformed week on ART: 1.095, 95% Confidence Interval-CI-[1.052-1.150].) Patients enrolled in higher-volume programs exhibited higher rates of clinician- assessed adherence (aOR per log-500 patients: 1.174, 95% CI [1.108-1.245]). Significant site-level variability in reported adherence was observed (0.28), with even higher variability among patients (0.71). In a sub-analysis, being an orphan at the start of ART was strongly associated with lower ART adherence rates (aOR: 0.919, 95% CI [0.864-0.976]). Conclusions Self-reported adherence remained high over a median of 1.8 years in HIV care, but varied according to patient-level and site-level factors. Consistent adherence monitoring with validated measures and attention to vulnerable groups is recommended.",,,"Ayaya, SO|Cohen, CR|Musick, BS|Nash, D|Vreeman, RC|Wabwire, D|Wiehe, SE|Wools-Kaloustian, K|Yiannoutsos, CT","Ayaya, Samuel O.|Cohen, Craig R.|Musick, Beverly S.|Nash, Denis|Vreeman, Rachel C.|Wabwire, Deo|Wiehe, Sarah E.|Wools-Kaloustian, Kara|Yiannoutsos, Constantin T.",,-1,,,,,,,-1,,-1,,,,,,,,Article,10.1371/journal.pone.0191848,,,,,Clarivate Analytics Web of Science,,,,,,1932-6203,2,,,PLOS ONE,,,e0191848,HUMAN-IMMUNODEFICIENCY-VIRUS|SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA|HIV-1-INFECTED CHILDREN|REPORTED ADHERENCE|DRUG-RESISTANCE|UNITED-KINGDOM|WESTERN KENYA|MORTALITY|UGANDA|AIDS,-1,,,,21-Feb,J,2018,,,,,,Multidisciplinary Sciences,,-1,,Science & Technology - Other Topics,,0,Adherence to antiretroviral therapy in a clinical cohort of HIV-infected children in East Africa,0,,WOS:000425604300018,1,13,,29466385,C:\Users\mginda\Desktop\agc1\wos-extract.isi,"Vreeman RC, 2018, V13, DOI 10.1371/journal.pone.0191848"
"Background: Misuse of prescription opioid analgesics (POA) has increased dramatically in the US, particularly in non-urban areas. We examined injection practices among persons who inject POA in a rural area that experienced a large HIV outbreak in 2015. Methods: Between August-September 2015,25 persons who injected drugs within the past 12 months were recruited in Scott County, Indiana for a qualitative study. Data from in-depth, semi-structured interviews were analyzed. Results: All 25 participants were non-Hispanic white and the median age was 33 years (range: 19-57). All had ever injected extended-release oxymorphone (Opana (R) ER) and most (n=20) described preparing Opana ER for multiple injections per injection episode (MIPIE). MIPIE comprised 2-4 injections during an injection episode resulting from needing >1 mL water to prepare Opana (R) ER solution using 1 mL syringes and the frequent use of ""rinse shots."" MIPIE occurred up to 10 times/day (totaling 35 injections/day), often in the context of sharing drug and injection equipment. Conclusions: We describe a high-risk injection practice that may have contributed to the rapid spread of HIV in this community. Efforts to prevent bloodborne infections among people who inject POA need to assess for MIPIE so that provision of sterile injection equipment and safer injection education addresses the MIPIE risk environment.

"Objective This study aimed to describe spatiotemporal correlates of pediatric violent injury in an urban community. Methods We performed a retrospective cohort study using patient-level data (2009-2011) from a novel emergency medical service computerized entry system for violent injury resulting in an ambulance dispatch among children aged 0 to 16 years. Assault location and patient residence location were cleaned and geocoded at a success rate of 98%. Distances from the assault location to both home and nearest school were calculated. Time and day of injury were used to evaluate temporal trends. Data from the event points were analyzed to locate injury hotspots. Results Seventy-six percent of events occurred within 2 blocks of the patient's home. Clusters of violent injury correlated with areas with high adult crime and areas with multiple schools. More than half of the events occurred between 3:00 pm and 11:00 pm. During these peak hours, Sundays had significantly fewer events.

"Ecologic momentary assessment (EMA) is a form of close-ended diary writing. While it has been shown that participating in a study that incorporates EMA improves mental health of participants, no study to date has examined the pathways through which benefits may occur. For 4-weeks, twice-daily EMAs and weekly interviews captured mood, daily activities and HIV risk behavior of 25 women who engage in transactional sex. Qualitative analysis of exit interviews was performed to examine how participation impacted women's mental health. The majority of participants felt that EMAs heightened awareness of emotions and behavior. Most reported experiencing catharsis from the interviews; specifically, from having a non-judgmental, trusting listener. Participants felt responsible for completing tasks, a sense of accomplishment for completing the study, and altruism. This study demonstrates there are direct benefits associated with participation in an EMA and interview study.",,"Wiehe, Sarah/R-6083-2017","Felsher, M|Gunn, JKL|Roth, AM|Wiehe, SE","Felsher, Marisa|Gunn, Jayleen K.

"Purpose: The purpose of this study was to assess the feasibility of using an existing computer decision support system to screen adolescent patients for suicidality and provide follow-up guidance to clinicians in a primary care setting. Predictors of patient endorsement of suicidality and provider documentation of follow-up were examined. Methods: A prospective cohort study was conducted to examine the implementation of a CDSS that screened adolescent patients for suicidality and provided follow-up recommendations to providers. The intervention was implemented for patients aged 12-20 years in two primary care clinics in Indianapolis, Indiana. Results: The sample included 2,134 adolescent patients (51% female; 60% black; mean age = 14.6 years [standard deviation = 2.1]). Just over 6% of patients screened positive for suicidality. A positive endorsement of suicidality was more common among patients who were female, depressed, and seen by an adolescent-medicine board-certified provider as opposed to general pediatric provider. Providers documented follow-up action for 83% of patients who screened positive for suicidality. Documentation of follow-up action was correlated with clinic site and Hispanic race. The majority of patients who endorsed suicidality (71%) were deemed not actively suicidal after assessment by their provider. Conclusions: Incorporating adolescent suicide screening and provider follow-up guidance into an existing computer decision support system in primary care is feasible and well utilized by providers. Female gender and depressive symptoms are consistently associated with suicidality among adolescents, although not all suicidal adolescents are depressed. Universal use of a multi-item suicide screener that assesses recency might more effectively identify suicidal adolescents. (C) 2017 Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine.

"Purpose: The objective of this study was to determine the effectiveness of computer-based screening and physician feedback to guide adolescent depression management within primary care. Methods: We conducted a prospective cohort study within two clinics of the computer-based depression screening and physician feedback algorithm among youth aged 12-20 years between October 2014 and October 2015 in Marion County (Indianapolis), Indiana. Results: Our sample included 2,038 youth (51% female; 60% black; mean age = 14.6 years [standard deviation = 2.1]). Over 20% of youth screened positive for depression on the Patient Health Questionnaire-2 and 303 youth (14.8%) screened positive on the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). The most common follow-up action by physicians was a referral to mental health services (34.2% mild, 46.8% moderate, and 72.2% severe range). Almost 11% of youth in the moderate range and 22.7% of youth in the severe range were already prescribed a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor. When predicting mental health service referral, significant predictors in the multivariate analysis included clinic site (40.2% vs. 73.9%; p < .0001) and PHQ-9 score (severe range 77.8% vs. mild range 47.5%; p < .01). Similarly, when predicting initiation of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, only clinic site (28.6% vs. 6.9%; p < .01) and PHQ-9 score (severe range 46.7% vs. moderate range 10.6%; p < .001) were significant. Conclusions: When a computer-based decision support system algorithm focused on adolescent depression was implemented in two primary care clinics, a majority of physicians utilized screening results to guide clinical care.

"BACKGROUND: Epilepsy and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are strongly associated; however, the underlying factors contributing to their co-occurrence remain unclear. A shared genetic liability has been proposed as one possible mechanism. Therefore, our goal in this study was to investigate the familial coaggregation of epilepsy and ADHD and to estimate the contribution of genetic and environmental risk factors to their co-occurrence. METHODS: We identified 1,899,654 individuals born between 1987 and 2006 via national Swedish registers and linked each individual to his or her biological relatives. We used logistic regression to estimate the association between epilepsy and ADHD within individual and across relatives. Quantitative genetic modeling was used to decompose the cross-disorder covariance into genetic and environmental factors. RESULTS: Individuals with epilepsy had a statistically significant increased risk of ADHD (odds ratio [OR] = 3.47, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 3.33-3.62). This risk increase extended to children whose mothers had epilepsy (OR = 1.85, 95% CI = 1.75-1.96), children whose fathers had epilepsy (OR = 1.64, 95% CI = 1.54-1.74), full siblings (OR = 1.56, 95% CI = 1.46-1.67), maternal half siblings (OR = 1.28, 95% CI = 1.14-1.43), paternal half siblings (OR = 1.10, 95% CI = 0.96-1.25), and cousins (OR = 1.15, 95% CI = 1.10-1.20). The genetic correlation was 0.21 (95% CI = 0.02-0.40) and explained 40% of the phenotypic correlation between epilepsy and ADHD, with the remaining variance largely explained by nonshared environmental factors (49%, nonshared environmental correlation = 0.36, 95% CI = 0.23-0.49). The contribution of shared environmental factors to the cross-disorder overlap was not statistically significant (11%, shared environmental correlation = 0.32, 95% CI = 20.16-0.79). CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates a strong and etiologically complex association between epilepsy and ADHD, with shared familial factors and risk factors unique to the individual contributing to co-occurrence of the disorders. Our findings suggest that epilepsy and ADHD may share less genetic risk as compared with other neurodevelopmental disorders.",,"Dalsgaard, Soren/I-4595-2013","Almqvist, C|Brikell, I|Dalsgaard, S|D'Onofrio, BM|Dunn, DW|Ghirardi, L|Kuja-Halkola, R|Larsson, H","Almqvist, Catarina|Brikell, Isabell|Dalsgaard, Soren|D'Onofrio, Brian M.|Dunn, David W.|Ghirardi, Laura|Kuja-Halkola, Ralf|Larsson, Henrik",173,-1,,,,,,,-1,,-1,,,,,,,,Article,10.1016/j.biopsych.2017.08.006,,,,180,Clarivate Analytics Web of Science,,,,,,0006-3223,2,,,BIOLOGICAL PSYCHIATRY,,,,DEFICIT HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER|GENETIC INFLUENCES|RISK-FACTORS|ADHD|CHILDREN|PREGNANCY|REGISTER|COAGGREGATION|METAANALYSIS|ASSOCIATION,-1,"Dalsgaard, Soren/0000-0003-4659-0969; Brikell, Isabell/0000-0002-3800-6665",ADHD|Comorbidity|Epilepsy|Genetics|Neurodevelopment|Risk factors,,15-Jan,J,2018,,,,,,Neurosciences|Psychiatry,,-1,,Neurosciences & Neurology; Psychiatry,,0,Familial Liability to Epilepsy and Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder: A Nationwide Cohort Study,0,,WOS:000417608300014,1,83,1873-2402,28950988,C:\Users\mginda\Desktop\agc1\wos-extract.isi,"Brikell I, 2018, V83, P173, DOI 10.1016/j.biopsych.2017.08.006"
"Background Recent research suggests that having a newborn child is associated with substantially reduced risk for maternal suicide. We studied postpartum suicides in a national cohort of mothers and the role of mental disorder, self-harm and delivery related factors. Methods We used a nested case-control design with data from Swedish registries. The cohort consisted of all women given birth in Sweden 1974-2009. Mothers who died by suicide during follow-up were considered cases (n = 1,786) and risk of suicide was estimated with proximity to delivery as the explanatory variable. In a second step, association between suicide during the first year following delivery (n = 145) and mental disorder, self-harm and delivery related variables risk factors were analyzed. Results The first postpartum year was associated with a lower risk of suicide, compared to later (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.66 +/- 0.96), which was unaltered after adjustment for socio-economic status and history of self-harm (aRR 0.82, 95% CI 0.68 +/- 0.99). Compared to living mothers, suicide victims of the postpartum year more often had affective disorders (aRR 133.94, 95% CI 45.93 +/- 390.61), psychotic disorders (aRR 83.69, 95% CI 36.99 +/- 189.31) and history of selfharm (aRR 47.56, 95% CI 18.24 +/- 124.02). The aRR of stillbirth was 2.66 (95% CI 0.63 +/- 11.30). Conclusions We found only a weak negative association between childbirth during the preceding year and suicide, when using mothers as controls. A severe mental disorder after delivery and a history of self-harm was strongly associated with increased risk of suicide in the postpartum year and may inform the clinical assessment postpartum.",,"Dickman, Paul/B-4572-2013; Dahlin, Marie/A-5489-2013","Dahlin, M|Dickman, P|D'Onofrio, BM|Ljungberg, E|Lysell, H|Runeson, B|Viktorin, A","Dahlin, Marie|Dickman, Paul|D'Onofrio, Brian M.|Ljungberg, Elsa|Lysell, Henrik|Runeson, Bo|Viktorin, Alexander",,-1,,,,,,,-1,,-1,,,,,,,,Article,10.1371/journal.pone.0190133,,,,,Clarivate Analytics Web of Science,,,,,,1932-6203,1,,,PLOS ONE,,,e0190133,COMPLETED SUICIDE|MENTAL-DISORDERS|RISK|DEATH|PREGNANCY,-1,"Dickman, Paul/0000-0002-5788-3380; Viktorin, Alexander/0000-0003-2141-2816",,,5-Jan,J,2018,,,,,,Multidisciplinary Sciences,,-1,,Science & Technology - Other Topics,,1,Maternal suicide - Register based study of all suicides occurring after delivery in Sweden 1974-2009,1,,WOS:000419403800035,1,13,,29304045,C:\Users\mginda\Desktop\agc1\wos-extract.isi,"Lysell H, 2018, V13, DOI 10.1371/journal.pone.0190133"

Secondary data analysis was conducted using data from the 2009 National College Health Assessment. Participants selected for this study were 4,336 Latino undergraduates. Linear mixed modeling was used to test gender as a moderator of the relationship between alcohol use norms and alcohol use as well as marijuana use norms and marijuana use. Results indicated that the strength of the relationships between norms and substance use was stronger for males than for females. Substance use rates and gender roles differ for Latinos and Latinas and may partially account for the stronger relationship between these constructs for males.

"Conduct disorder (CD) symptoms cooccur at high rates with illicit drug use in juvenile justice involved youth, which results in poorer outcomes; however, research has not identified where best to intervene in this relationship, limiting the identification of modifiable risk factors to reduce negative effects of CD symptoms. Two mediation models were examined to investigate the potential for CD symptoms to influence a reciprocal relationship between illicit drug use and positive drug attitudes, controlling for age, gender, and race. Data were examined for 245 juvenile justice involved youth (mean age = 15.46, SD = 1.30, range 12-18, 64.9% Black, 80.4% male) who completed court-ordered psychological assessments. Findings indicate: (1) Positive attitudes toward illicit drug use significantly mediated the relationship between CD symptoms and illicit drug use ( = 0.16, CI 0.09-0.27; test for indirect effect z = 4.17, p < .001) and (2) illicit drug use significantly mediated the relationship between CD symptoms and positive attitudes toward illicit drug use ( = 0.20, CI 0.12-0.32; test for indirect effect z = 4.87, p < .001). Overall, the present study suggests that CD symptoms impart risk for illicit drug use both indirectly, through more positive attitudes toward illicit drug use, and directly, which further strengthens positive attitudes toward illicit drug use.",,,"Aalsma, MC|Cyders, MA|Hershberger, AR|Kolp, HM|Sanders, J|Um, M","Aalsma, Matthew C.|Cyders, Melissa A.|Hershberger, Alexandra R.|Kolp, Haley M.|Sanders, Jasmyn|Um, Miji",1252,-1,,,,,,,-1,,-1,,,,,,,,Article,10.1080/10826084.2017.1402058,,,,1259,Clarivate Analytics Web of Science,,,,,,1082-6084,8,,,SUBSTANCE USE & MISUSE,,,,SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS|MALE-ADOLESCENTS|PSYCHIATRIC-DISORDERS|OPPOSITIONAL DEFIANT|ABUSE|RISK|INITIATION|DELINQUENCY|RECIDIVISM|DETENTION,-1,,Attitudes|conduct disorder|illicit drug use|juvenile justice|youth,,,J,2018,,,,,,Substance Abuse|Psychiatry|Psychology,,-1,,Substance Abuse; Psychiatry; Psychology,,0,Conduct Disorder Symptoms and Illicit Drug Use in Juvenile Justice Involved Youth: The Reciprocal Relationship Between Positive Illicit Drug-Use Attitudes and Illicit Drug Use,0,,WOS:000434687300003,1,53,1532-2491,29185888,C:\Users\mginda\Desktop\agc1\wos-extract.isi,"Kolp HM, 2018, V53, P1252, DOI 10.1080/10826084.2017.1402058"
"Background: Exploratory laparotomy in children after motor vehicle collision (MVC) is rare. In the absence of definitive hemorrhage or free abdominal air on radiographic imaging, predictors for operative exploration are conflicting. Objective: The purpose of this study was to explore objective findings that may aid in determining which children require operative abdominal exploration after MVC. Methods: Data from 2010-2014 at an American College of Surgeons-certified level 1 pediatric trauma center were retrospectively reviewed. Demographics, vital signs, laboratory data, radiologic studies, operative records, associated injuries, and outcomes were analyzed and p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results: Eight hundred sixty-two patients 0-18 years of age presented to the hospital after an MVC during the study period. Seventeen patients (2.0%) required abdominal exploration and all were found to have intraabdominal injuries. Respiratory rate was the only vital sign that was significantly altered (p = 0.04) in those who required abdominal surgery compared with those who did not. Physical examination findings, such as the seat belt sign, abdominal bruising, abdominal wound, and abdominal tenderness, were present significantly more frequently in those requiring abdominal surgery (p < 0.0001). Each finding had a negative predictive value for the need for operative exploration of at least 0.98. There were no significant differences in trauma laboratory values or radiographic findings between the 2 groups. Conclusion: Data from this study solidify the relationship between specific physical examination findings and the need for abdominal exploration after MVC in children. In addition, these data suggest that a lack of the seat belt sign, abdominal bruising, abdominal wounds, or abdominal tenderness are individually predictive of patients who will not require surgical intervention.

DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This population-based birth cohort study included 2 115 554 individuals who were born in Sweden between January 1, 1976, and December 31, 1998, and followed up through December 31, 2013. Using the Swedish National Patient Register and previously validated International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) codes, we identified persons with OCD; within the cohort, we identified 726 198 families with 2 or more full siblings, and identified 11 482 families with full siblings discordant for OCD. Data analyses were conducted from October 1, 2016, to September 25, 2017. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The study evaluates the following educational milestones: eligibility to access upper secondary school after compulsory education, finishing upper secondary school, starting a university degree, finishing a university degree, and finishing postgraduate education. RESULTS Of the 2 115 554 individuals in the cohort, 15 120 were diagnosed with OCD (59% females). Compared with unexposed individuals, those with OCD were significantly less likely to pass all core and additional courses at the end of compulsory school (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] range, 0.35-0.60) and to access a vocational or academic program in upper secondary education (aOR, 0.47; 95% CI, 0.45-0.50 and aOR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.58-0.63, for vocational and academic programs, respectively). People with OCD were also less likely to finish upper secondary education (aOR, 0.43; 95% CI, 0.41-0.44), start a university degree (aOR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.69-0.75), finish a university degree (aOR, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.56-0.62), and finish postgraduate education (aOR, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.36-0.77). The results were similar in the sibling comparison models. Individuals diagnosed with OCD before age 18 years showed worse educational attainment across all educational levels compared with those diagnosed at or after age 18 years. Exclusion of patients with comorbid neuropsychiatric disorders, psychotic, anxiety, mood, substance use, and other psychiatric disorders resulted in attenuated estimates, but patients with OCD were still impaired across all educational outcomes. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Obsessive-compulsive disorder, particularly when it has an early onset, is associated with a pervasive and profound decrease in educational attainment, spanning from compulsory school to postgraduate education.",,,"Brander, G|D'Onofrio, BM|Feldman, I|Fernandez de la Cruz, L|Hesselmark, E|Isomura, K|Jangmo, A|Kuja-Halkola, R|Larsson, H|Lazaro, L|Mataix-Cols, D|Perez-Vigil, A|Ruck, C|Serlachius, E","Brander, Gustaf|D'Onofrio, Brian M.|Feldman, Inna|Fernandez de la Cruz, Lorena|Hesselmark, Eva|Isomura, Kayoko|Jangmo, Andreas|Kuja-Halkola, Ralf|Larsson, Henrik|Lazaro, Luisa|Mataix-Cols, David|Perez-Vigil, Ana|Ruck, Christian|Serlachius, Eva",47,-1,,,,,,,-1,,-1,,,,,,,,Article,10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2017.3523,,,,55,Clarivate Analytics Web of Science,,,,,,2168-622X,1,,,JAMA PSYCHIATRY,,,,MENTAL-DISORDERS|PSYCHIATRIC-DISORDERS|AFRICAN-AMERICANS|FOLLOW-UP|POPULATION|ONSET|ADOLESCENTS|CHILDHOOD|COUNTRIES|CHILDREN,-1,,,,JAN,J,2018,,,,,,Psychiatry,,-1,,Psychiatry,,3,Association of Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder With Objective Indicators of Educational Attainment A Nationwide Register-Based Sibling Control Study,3,,WOS:000419177700010,1,75,2168-6238,29141084,C:\Users\mginda\Desktop\agc1\wos-extract.isi,"Perez-Vigil A, 2018, V75, P47, DOI 10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2017.3523"
"BACKGROUND Hospital-based violence intervention programs (HVIP) aim to reduce violent-injury recidivism by providing intensive case management services to high-risk patients who were violently injured. Although HVIP have been found effective at reducing recidivism, few studies have sought to identity how long their effects last. Additionally, prior studies have been limited by the fact that HVIP typically rely on self-report or data within their own healthcare system to identify new injuries. Our aim was to quantify the long-term recidivism rate of participants in an HVIP program using more objective and comprehensive data from a regional health information exchange. METHODS The study included 328 patients enrolled in Prescription for Hope (RxH), an HVIP, between January 2009 and August 2016. We obtained RxH participants' emergency department (ED) encounter data from a regional health information exchange database from the date of hospital discharge to February 2017. Our primary outcome was violent-injury recidivism rate of the RxH program. We also examined reasons for ED visits that were unrelated to violent injury. RESULTS We calculated a 4.4% recidivism rate based on 8 years of statewide data, containing 1,575 unique encounters. More than 96% of participants were matched in the state database. Of the 15 patients who recidivated, only five were admitted for their injury. More than half of new violence-related injuries were treated outside of the HVIP-affiliated trauma center. The most common reasons for ED visits were pain (718 encounters), followed by suspected complications or needing additional postoperative care (181 encounters). Substance abuse, unintentional injuries, and suicidal ideation were also frequent reasons for ED visits. CONCLUSION The low, long-term recidivism rate for RxH indicates that HVIPs have enduring positive effects on the majority of participants. Our results suggest that HVIP may further benefit patients by partnering with organizations that work to prevent suicide, substance use disorders, and other unintentional injuries.

"The authors describe the first 11 academic years (2005-2006 through 2016-2017) of a longitudinal, small-group faculty development program for strengthening humanistic teaching and role modeling at 30 U.S. and Canadian medical schools that continues today. During the yearlong program, small groups of participating faculty met twice monthly with a local facilitator for exercises in humanistic teaching, role modeling, and related topics that combined narrative reflection with skills training using experiential learning techniques. The program focused on the professional development of its participants. Thirty schools participated; 993 faculty, including some residents, completed the program. In evaluations, participating faculty at 13 of the schools scored significantly more positively as rated by learners on all dimensions of medical humanism than did matched controls. Qualitative analyses from several cohorts suggest many participants had progressed to more advanced stages of professional identity formation after completing the program. Strong engagement and attendance by faculty participants as well as the multimodal evaluation suggest that the program may serve as a model for others. Recently, most schools adopting the program have offered the curriculum annually to two or more groups of faculty participants to create sufficient numbers of trained faculty to positively influence humanistic teaching at the institution. The authors discuss the program's learning theory, outline its curriculum, reflect on the program's accomplishments and plans for the future, and state how faculty trained in such programs could lead institutional initiatives and foster positive change in humanistic professional development at all levels of medical education.",,,"Branch, WT|Derse, AR|Dunne, DW|Frankel, RM|Gilligan, MC|Hafler, JP|Litzelman, DK|May, NB|Osterberg, LG|Plews-Ogan, M|Rider, EA|Weil, AB","Branch, William T., Jr.|Derse, Arthur R.|Dunne, Dana W.|Frankel, Richard M.|Gilligan, MaryAnn C.|Hafler, Janet P.|Litzelman, Debra K.|May, Natalie B.|Osterberg, Lars G.|Plews-Ogan, Margaret|Rider, Elizabeth A.|Weil, Amy B.",1680,-1,,,,,,,-1,,-1,,,,,,,,Article,10.1097/ACM.0000000000001940,,,,1686,Clarivate Analytics Web of Science,,,,,,1040-2446,12,,,ACADEMIC MEDICINE,,,,RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED-TRIAL|HARVARD MEDICAL-SCHOOL|IDENTITY FORMATION|COMMUNICATION-SKILLS|HIDDEN CURRICULUM|HUMAN DIMENSIONS|EDUCATION|STUDENTS|PHYSICIANS|CARE,-1,,,,DEC,J,2017,,,,,,"Education, Scientific Disciplines|Health Care Sciences & Services",,-1,,Education & Educational Research; Health Care Sciences & Services,,5,A Multi-Institutional Longitudinal Faculty Development Program in Humanism Supports the Professional Development of Faculty Teachers,5,,WOS:000419151600023,1,92,1938-808X,28991846,C:\Users\mginda\Desktop\agc1\wos-extract.isi,"Branch WT, 2017, V92, P1680, DOI 10.1097/ACM.0000000000001940"
"OBJECTIVE: To examine associations among interpregnancy interval, the duration from the preceding birth to the conception of the next-born index child, and adverse birth outcomes using designs that adjust for measured and unmeasured factors. METHODS: In this prospective cohort study, we used population-based Swedish registries from 1973 to 2009 to estimate the associations between interpregnancy interval (referent 18-23 months) and adverse birth outcomes (ie, preterm birth [less than 37 weeks of gestation], low birth weight [LBW; less than 2,500 g], small for gestational age [SGA; greater than 2 SDs below average weight for gestational age]). Analyses included cousin and sibling comparisons and postbirth intervals (ie, the interval between secondborn and thirdborn offspring predicting secondborn outcomes) to address unmeasured familial confounding. RESULTS: Traditional cohort-wide analyses showed higher odds of preterm birth (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 1.51, 99% CI 1.39-1.63, 5.99% preterm births]) and LBW (adjusted OR 1.25, 99% CI 1.13-1.39, 3.32% LBW) after a short interpregnancy interval (0-5 months) compared with offspring born after an interpregnancy interval of 18-23 months (3.21% preterm births, 1.92% LBW). Except for preterm birth (adjusted OR 1.72, 99% CI 1.26-2.35), associations were attenuated in cousin comparisons. A small association between a short interpregnancy interval and preterm birth remained in sibling comparisons (adjusted OR 1.22, 99% CI 1.11-1.35), but associations with LBW (adjusted OR 0.83, 99% CI 0.74-0.94) and SGA (adjusted OR 0.74, 99% CI 0.64-0.85) reversed direction. For pregnancy intervals of 60 months or more, odds of preterm birth (adjusted OR 1.51, 99% CI 1.431.60, 5.07% preterm births), LBW (adjusted OR 1.61, 99% CI 1.50-1.73, 3.43% low-birth-weight births), and SGA (adjusted OR 1.54, 99% CI 1.42-1.66, 2.49% SGA births) were also higher when compared with the reference interval (1.53% SGA). Associations between long interpregnancy interval and adverse birth outcomes remained through cousin and sibling comparisons. Postbirth interval analyses showed familial confounding is present for short interpregnancy intervals, but supported independent associations for long interpregnancy intervals. CONCLUSION: Familial confounding explains most of the association between a short interpregnancy interval and adverse birth outcomes, whereas associations with long interpregnancy intervals were independent of measured and unmeasured factors.",,,"Almqvist, C|Class, QA|D'Onofrio, BM|Larsson, H|Lichtenstein, P|Oberg, AS|Rickert, ME|Sujan, AC","Almqvist, Catarina|Class, Quetzal A.|D'Onofrio, Brian M.|Larsson, Henrik|Lichtenstein, Paul|Oberg, Anna S.|Rickert, Martin|Sujan, Ayesha C.",1304,-1,,,,,,,-1,,-1,,,,,,,,Article,10.1097/AOG.0000000000002358,,,,1311,Clarivate Analytics Web of Science,,,,,,0029-7844,6,,,OBSTETRICS AND GYNECOLOGY,,,,PRETERM BIRTH|PERINATAL OUTCOMES|PREGNANCY OUTCOMES|NEONATAL DEATH|RISK|DEPLETION|HEALTH,-1,,,,DEC,J,2017,,,,,,Obstetrics & Gynecology,,-1,,Obstetrics & Gynecology,,0,Within-Family Analysis of Interpregnancy Interval and Adverse Birth Outcomes,0,,WOS:000419132400019,1,130,,29112654,C:\Users\mginda\Desktop\agc1\wos-extract.isi,"Class QA, 2017, V130, P1304, DOI 10.1097/AOG.0000000000002358"
"Use of exogenous cannabinoids disrupts the fine-tuned endocannabinoid receptor system, possibly leading to alterations in cognition, memory, and emotional processes that endure long after cannabinoid use has stopped. Long-term adolescent use may uniquely disrupt these behaviors when compared to adult use. The current study explored the acute and long-term behavioral effects of six 10 mg/kg Delta 9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) injections across the adolescent or early adult period in male inbred C57B1/6J and DBA/2J mice. The acute and prolonged effects of THC on object memory using the novel object recognition task, unconditioned anxiety in the elevated plus maze and open field, and sedative effects in the open field were examined. Acute THC treatment resulted in anxiogenic activity in both strains, but only caused sedation in B6 mice. Repeated THC treatment resulted in a protracted effect on object recognition, but not unconditioned anxiety, assessed 4 weeks later. In both strains, an adolescent history of THC treatment disrupted later object recognition. Interestingly, in B6 mice an adult history of THC exposure appeared to rescue a deficit in object recognition observed in vehicle-treated adults. Repeated THC administration also produced a protracted effected on CB1R protein expression. Animals treated with THC in adolescence maintained increased levels of CB1R protein expression compared to their adult THC-treated counterparts at five weeks following the last injection. These results indicate that THC use may have long-lasting effects with adolescence being a unique period of susceptibility.",,,"Boehm, SL|Kasten, CR|Zhang, YP","Boehm, Stephen L., II|Kasten, Chelsea R.|Zhang, Yanping",9,-1,,,,,,,-1,,-1,,,,,,,,Article,10.1016/j.pbb.2017.10.012,,,,19,Clarivate Analytics Web of Science,,,,,,0091-3057,,,,PHARMACOLOGY BIOCHEMISTRY AND BEHAVIOR,,,,ANIMAL-MODELS|ADOLESCENT EXPOSURE|PLANT CANNABINOIDS|DBA/2 MICE|ADULT RATS|DELTA(9)-TETRAHYDROCANNABINOL|BRAIN|BEHAVIOR|CANNABIDIOL|MEMORY,-1,"Kasten, Chelsea/0000-0002-6502-1051",THC|Cannabinoids|Adolescence|Memory|Anxiety|CB1R,,DEC,J,2017,,,,,,Behavioral Sciences|Neurosciences|Pharmacology & Pharmacy,,-1,,Behavioral Sciences; Neurosciences & Neurology; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,,1,Acute and long-term effects of Delta 9-tetrahydrocannabinol on object recognition and anxiety-like activity are age- and strain-dependent in mice,1,,WOS:000418215800002,1,163,,29107728,C:\Users\mginda\Desktop\agc1\wos-extract.isi,"Kasten CR, 2017, V163, P9, DOI 10.1016/j.pbb.2017.10.012"

"Objective: Major reorganizations of medical practice today challenge physicians' ability to deliver compassionate care. We sought to understand how physicians who completed an intensive faculty development program in medical humanism sustain their humanistic practices. Methods: Program completers from 8 U.S. medical schools wrote reflections in answer to two open-ended questions addressing their personal motivations and the barriers that impeded their humanistic practice and teaching. Reflections were qualitatively analyzed using the constant comparative method. Results: Sixty-eight physicians (74% response rate) submitted reflections. Motivating factors included: 1) identification with humanistic values; 2) providing care that they or their family would want; 3) connecting to patients; 4) passing on values through role modelling; 5) being in the moment. Inhibiting factors included: 1) time, 2) stress, 3) culture, and 4) episodic burnout. Conclusions: Determination to live by one's values, embedded within a strong professional identity, allowed study participants to alleviate, but not resolve, the barriers. Collaborative action to address organizational impediments was endorsed but found to be lacking. Practice implications: Fostering fully mature professional development among physicians will require new skills and opportunities that reinforce time-honored values while simultaneously partnering with others to nurture, sustain and improve patient care by addressing system issues.

"Where one looks within their environment constrains one's visual experiences, directly affects cognitive, emotional, and social processing [1-4], influences learning opportunities [5], and ultimately shapes one's developmental path. While there is a high degree of similarity across individuals with regard to which features of a scene are fixated [6-8], large individual differences are also present, especially in disorders of development [9-13], and clarifying the origins of these differences is essential to understand the processes by which individuals develop within the complex environments in which they exist and interact. Toward this end, a recent paper [14] found that ""social visual engagement''-namely, gaze to eyes and mouths of faces-is strongly influenced by genetic factors. However, whether genetic factors influence gaze to complex visual scenes more broadly, impacting how both social and non-social scene content are fixated, as well as general visual exploration strategies, has yet to be determined. Using a behavioral genetic approach and eye tracking data from a large sample of 11-year-old human twins (233 same-sex twin pairs; 51% monozygotic, 49% dizygotic), we demonstrate that genetic factorsdoindeedcontribute strongly to eye movement patterns, influencing both one's general tendency for visual exploration of scene content, as well as the precise moment-to-moment spatiotemporal pattern of fixations during viewing of complex social and non-social scenes alike. This study adds to a now growing set of results that together illustrate howgeneticsmaybroadly influence the process by which individuals actively shape and create their own visual experiences.",,,"Bolte, S|D'Onofrio, BM|Falck-Ytter, T|Kennedy, DP|Lichtenstein, P|Quinn, PD","Bolte, Sven|D'Onofrio, Brian M.|Falck-Ytter, Terje|Kennedy, Daniel P.|Lichtenstein, Paul|Quinn, Patrick D.",3554,-1,,,,,,,-1,,-1,,,,,,,,Article,10.1016/j.cub.2017.10.007,,,,+,Clarivate Analytics Web of Science,,,,,,0960-9822,22,,,CURRENT BIOLOGY,,,,AUTISM|TWIN|TRACKING|INFANTS|PATTERNS|CHILDREN|BEHAVIOR|GAZE|RISK|HERITABILITY,-1,,,,20-Nov,J,2017,,,,,,Biochemistry & Molecular Biology|Cell Biology,,-1,,Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Cell Biology,,2,Genetic Influence on Eye Movements to Complex Scenes at Short Timescales,2,,WOS:000415815800034,1,27,1879-0445,29129535,C:\Users\mginda\Desktop\agc1\wos-extract.isi,"Kennedy DP, 2017, V27, P3554, DOI 10.1016/j.cub.2017.10.007"
"In January 2015, an outbreak of undiagnosed human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections among persons who inject drugs (PWID) was recognized in rural Indiana. By September 2016, 205 persons in this community of approximately 4400 had received a diagnosis of HIV infection. We report results of new approaches to analyzing epidemiologic and laboratory data to understand transmission during this outbreak. HIV genetic distances were calculated using the polymerase region. Networks were generated using data about reported high-risk contacts, viral genetic similarity, and their most parsimonious combinations. Sample collection dates and recency assay results were used to infer dates of infection. Epidemiologic and laboratory data each generated large and dense networks. Integration of these data revealed subgroups with epidemiologic and genetic commonalities, one of which appeared to contain the earliest infections. Predicted infection dates suggest that transmission began in 2011, underwent explosive growth in mid-2014, and slowed after the declaration of a public health emergency. Results from this phylodynamic analysis suggest that the majority of infections had likely already occurred when the investigation began and that early transmission may have been associated with sexual activity and injection drug use. Early and sustained efforts are needed to detect infections and prevent or interrupt rapid transmission within networks of uninfected PWID.",,,"Blosser, SJ|Brooks, JT|Campbell, EM|Chapman, EL|Duwve, JM|Galang, RR|Gentry, J|Hanson, D|Heneine, W|Jia, HW|Kagan, RM|Luo, W|Masciotra, S|Oster, AM|Owen, SM|Peters, PJ|Peyrani, P|Pontones, P|Roseberry, JC|Shankar, A|Spiller, MW|Switzer, WM|Whitcomb, JM","Blosser, Sara J.|Brooks, John T.|Campbell, Ellsworth M.|Chapman, Erika L.|Duwve, Joan M.|Galang, Romeo R.|Gentry, Jessica|Hanson, Debra|Heneine, Walid|Jia, Hongwei|Kagan, Ron M.|Luo, Wei|Masciotra, Silvina|Oster, Alexandra M.|Owen, S.

"Patients with Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and comorbid Substance Use Disorders (SUD) are increasingly being treated with central stimulant medication despite limited evidence for its effectiveness. Lack of longitudinal follow-up studies of dosing and adverse effects has resulted in conflicting treatment guidelines. This study aims to explore whether individuals with ADHD and comorbid SUD are treated with higher stimulant doses than individuals with ADHD only, and whether doses increase over time as a sign of tolerance, a core symptom of addiction. Information on methylphenidate doses for 14 314 Swedish adults, including 4870 individuals with comorbid SUD was obtained through linkages of Swedish national registers between 2006 and 2009. Differences in doses between patients with and without SUD were estimated using logistic regression while a linear regression model calculated time trends in mean doses. Individuals with SUD were prescribed higher methylphenidate doses than those without (ORday365; 2.12, 95% CI 1.81-2.47: ORday730 2.65, 95% CI 2.13-3.30). Patients with SUD were, two years after initiating stimulant treatment, prescribed approximately 40% higher doses compared to individuals with ADHD only. The results may suggest a need for increased doses in this population to achieve optimal ADHD symptom control. A tendency towards increasing doses during the first years of treatment, more pronounced in individuals with comorbid SUD, may reflect a reluctance to prescribe adequate doses due to lack of clinical guidelines. Mean doses stabilized after about two years in both groups, which does not lend support to continuously increasing tolerance over time. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. and ECNP.

"Context: A national system of voluntary public health accreditation for state, local, and tribal health departments (local health departments [LHDs]) is part of a movement that aims to improve public health performance with ultimate impact on population health outcomes. Indiana is a good setting for the study of LHD accreditation adoption because several LHDs reported de-adopting accreditation in a recent statewide survey and because 71% of Indiana counties serve populations of 50 000 or less. Design: A systematic method of analyzing qualitative data based on the Performance Improvement Model framework to expand our understanding of de-adoption of public health accreditation. Setting/Participants: In 2015, we conducted a key informant interview study of the 3 LHDs that decided to delay their engagement in the accreditation based on findings from an Indiana survey on LHD accreditation adoption. The study is an exploration of LHD accreditation de-adoption and of the contributions made to its understanding by the Performance Improvement Model. Result: The study found that top management team members are those who champion accreditation adoption, and that organizational structure and culture facilitate the staff's embracing of the change. The Performance Improvement Model was found to enhance the elucidation of the inner domain elements of Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research in the context of de-adoption of public health accreditation. Conclusion: Governing entities' policies and priorities appear to mediate whether the LHDs are able to continue accreditation pursuit. Lacking any of these driving forces appears to be associated with decisions to de-adoption of accreditation. Further work is necessary to discern specific elements mediating decisions to pursue accreditation. This study demonstrates the added knowledge of Performance Improvement Model (PIM) to the CFIR framework. A large scale study is called to further clarify and discern supports of specific to the needs of individual LHDs for their performance improvement effort.",,,"King, J|Liu, SS|Meyerson, BE|Ostovari, M|Yih, Y","King, Jerry|Liu, Sandra S.|Meyerson, Beth E.|Ostovari, Mina|Yih, Yuehwern",E25,-1,,,,,,,-1,,-1,,,,,,,,Article,10.1097/PHH.0000000000000567,,,,E35,Clarivate Analytics Web of Science,,,,,,1078-4659,6,,,JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH MANAGEMENT AND PRACTICE,,,,PUBLIC-HEALTH|ORGANIZATIONAL-STRUCTURE|NATIONAL ACCREDITATION|QUALITY IMPROVEMENT|CULTURE|POLICY|LEVEL|IMPLEMENTATION|INCENTIVES|MANAGERS,-1,,Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR)|implementation science|local health department (LHD)|Performance Improvement Model (PIM)|public health accreditation,,NOV-DEC,J,2017,,,,,,"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health",,-1,,"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health",,0,Drivers and Barriers for Adopting Accreditation at Local Health Departments for Their Performance Improvement Effort,0,,WOS:000412176000005,1,23,1550-5022,28492448,C:\Users\mginda\Desktop\agc1\wos-extract.isi,"Liu SS, 2017, V23, E25, DOI 10.1097/PHH.0000000000000567"
"The risk of death by suicide in individuals with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is largely unknown. Previous studies have been small and methodologically flawed. We analyzed data from the Swedish national registers to estimate the risk of suicide in OCD and identify the risk and protective factors associated with suicidal behavior in this group. We used a matched case-cohort design to estimate the risk of deaths by suicide and attempted suicide in individuals diagnosed with OCD, compared with matched general population controls (1: 10). Cox regression models were used to study predictors of suicidal behavior. We identified 36 788 OCD patients in the Swedish National Patient Register between 1969 and 2013. Of these, 545 had died by suicide and 4297 had attempted suicide. In unadjusted models, individuals with OCD had an increased risk of both dying by suicide (odds ratio (OR) = 9.83 (95% confidence interval (CI), 8.72-11.08)) and attempting suicide (OR = 5.45 (95% CI, 5.24-5.67)), compared with matched controls. After adjusting for psychiatric comorbidities, the risk was reduced but remained substantial for both death by suicide and attempted suicide. Within the OCD cohort, a previous suicide attempt was the strongest predictor of death by suicide. Having a comorbid personality or substance use disorder also increased the risk of suicide. Being a woman, higher parental education and having a comorbid anxiety disorder were protective factors. We conclude that patients with OCD are at a substantial risk of suicide. Importantly, this risk remains substantial after adjusting for psychiatric comorbidities. Suicide risk should be carefully monitored in patients with OCD.",,"Rosenqvist, Mina/P-6531-2018","Brander, G|D'Onofrio, BM|Fernandez de la Cruz, L|Larsson, H|Lichtenstein, P|Mataix-Cols, D|Ruck, C|Runeson, B|Rydell, M","Brander, Gustaf|D'Onofrio, Brian M.|Fernandez de la Cruz, Lorena|Larsson, Henrik|Lichtenstein, Paul|Mataix-Cols, David|Ruck, Christian|Runeson, Bo|Rydell, Mina",1626,-1,,,,,,,-1,,-1,,,,,,,,Article,10.1038/mp.2016.115,,,,1632,Clarivate Analytics Web of Science,,,,,,1359-4184,11,,,MOLECULAR PSYCHIATRY,,,,QUALITY-OF-LIFE|PSYCHOLOGICAL AUTOPSY|FOLLOW-UP|METAANALYSIS|MORTALITY|BEHAVIOR|COHORT|COMORBIDITY|DEPRESSION|PREVALENCE,-1,"Rosenqvist, Mina/0000-0002-2788-2061; Fernandez de la Cruz, Lorena/0000-0002-1571-5485",,,NOV,J,2017,,,,,,Biochemistry & Molecular Biology|Neurosciences|Psychiatry,,-1,,Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Neurosciences & Neurology; Psychiatry,,6,Suicide in obsessive-compulsive disorder: a population-based study of 36788 Swedish patients,6,,WOS:000413652400013,1,22,1476-5578,27431293,C:\Users\mginda\Desktop\agc1\wos-extract.isi,"Fernandez de la Cruz L, 2017, V22, P1626, DOI 10.1038/mp.2016.115"
"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Youth involved in the juvenile justice system (ie, arrested youth) are at risk for health problems. Although increasing preventive care use by justice-involved youth (JIY) is 1 approach to improving their well-being, little is known about their access to and use of care. The objective of this study was to determine how rates of well-child (WC) and emergency department visits, as well as public insurance enrollment continuity, differed between youth involved in the justice system and youth who have never been in the system. We hypothesized that JIY would exhibit less frequent WC and more frequent emergency service use than non-justice-involved youth (NJIY). METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study of administrative medical and criminal records of all youth (ages 12-18) enrolled in Medicaid in Marion County, Indiana, between January 1, 2004, and December 31, 2011. RESULTS: The sample included 88 647 youth; 20 668 (23%) were involved in the justice system. JIY had lower use rates of WC visits and higher use rates of emergency services in comparison with NJIY. JIY had more and longer gaps in Medicaid coverage compared with NJIY. For all youth sampled, both preventive and emergency services use varied significantly by Medicaid enrollment continuity. CONCLUSIONS: JIY experience more and longer gaps in Medicaid coverage, and rely more on emergency services than NJIY. Medicaid enrollment continuity was associated with differences in WC and emergency service use among JIY, with policy implications for improving preventive care for these vulnerable youth.",,"Wiehe, Sarah/R-6083-2017","Aalsma, MC|Anderson, VR|Ouyang, FQ|Rosenman, MB|Schwartz, K|Tu, WZ|Wiehe, SE","Aalsma, Matthew C.|Anderson, Valerie R.|Ouyang, Fangqian|Rosenman, Marc B.|Schwartz, Katherine|Tu, Wanzhu|Wiehe, Sarah E.",,-1,,,,,,,-1,,-1,,,,,,,,Article,10.1542/peds.2017-1107,,,,,Clarivate Analytics Web of Science,,,,,,0031-4005,5,,,PEDIATRICS,,,e20171107,EMERGENCY-DEPARTMENT UTILIZATION|HEALTH-CARE|PSYCHIATRIC-DISORDERS|JUVENILE DETENTION|DELINQUENT YOUTH|RISK BEHAVIORS|MEDICAID|INSURANCE|IMPACT|CHILDREN,-1,"Wiehe, Sarah/0000-0002-8148-0848",,,NOV,J,2017,,,,,,Pediatrics,,-1,,Pediatrics,,1,Preventive Care Use Among Justice-Involved and Non-Justice-Involved Youth,1,,WOS:000414119600028,1,140,1098-4275,28970371,C:\Users\mginda\Desktop\agc1\wos-extract.isi,"Aalsma MC, 2017, V140, DOI 10.1542/peds.2017-1107"

"Substance use during adolescence is a public health concern due to associated physical and behavioral health consequences. Such consequences are amplified among concurrent substance users. Although sex and racial/ethnic differences in single-substance use have been observed, the current literature is inconclusive as to whether differences exist in the prevalence of concurrent use. The current study used data from the 2011-2014 National Survey on Drug Use and Health to examine typologies (single and concurrent patterns) of alcohol, marijuana, and cigarette use among current adolescent users age 12-18 by sex and race/ethnicity. Participants were 14,667 White, Hispanic, African American, Asian, and Native American adolescents. The most common typology was alcohol only, followed by concurrent use of alcohol and marijuana. Weighted prevalence estimates indicated that adolescent females were more likely to be current users of alcohol only, whereas male adolescents were more likely to belong to all other typologies. Compared to Whites, racial/ethnic minorities had larger proportions of marijuana only users and were generally less likely than or equally likely to be concurrent users. One exception was for African American adolescents, who were more likely to be alcohol and marijuana users than their White counterparts. Results suggest that concurrent substance use is common among U.S. adolescents, making up over 40% of past-month use, but typologies of use vary by sex and race/ethnicity. Preventive interventions should consider all typologies of use rather than only single substance exposures and address patterns of use that are most pertinent to adolescents based on sex and race/ethnicity.",,,"Banks, DE|Mpofu, P|Rowe, AT|Zapolski, TCB","Banks, Devin E.|Mpofu, Philani|Rowe, Alia T.|Zapolski, Tamika C.

"Background: Human papillomavirus (HPV) infections cause approximately 30,700 cancers annually among US men and women, cervical cancer being the most common. Human papillomavirus vaccination is recommended routinely for US girls and boys at age 11 to 12 years, and for those not previously vaccinated, through age 26 and 21 years for women and men, respectively. Our objective was to assess current cervical cancer screening and HPV vaccination practices among sexually transmitted disease (STD) clinics in the United States. Methods: We surveyed a geographically diverse convenience sample of US STD clinics identified by members of the National Coalition of STD Directors within 65 state, territorial, and local jurisdictions. An online multiple-choice survey about clinical services was administered to clinic directors or designees during October 2014 to February 2015. Results: Survey respondents included 78 clinics from 46 states and territories. Of these clinics, 31 (39.7%) offered both cervical cancer screening and HPV vaccination, 6 (7.7%) offered cervical cancer screening only, 21 (26.9%) offered HPV vaccination only, and 20 (25.6%) offered neither cervical cancer prevention service. Among those not offering the service, the most commonly reported barrier to cervical cancer screening was time constraints (25/41, 61.0%); for HPV vaccination it was reimbursement (11/26, 42.3%). Conclusions: By early 2015, in a geographically diverse group of 78 STD clinics, 39.7% provided nationally recommended HPV vaccination and cervical cancer screening, whereas 25.6% provided neither. Further research could identify strategies for STD clinics to reduce HPV-associated cancers by increasing provision of HPV vaccination and cervical cancer screening services, particularly among medically underserved populations.",,,"Griesse, R|Haderxhanaj, LT|Markowitz, LE|McGinnis, E|Meites, E|Meyerson, BE|Saraiya, M|Smith, W|Snoek, E","Griesse, Rebecca|Haderxhanaj, Laura T.|Markowitz, Lauri E.|McGinnis, Emily|Meites, Elissa|Meyerson, Beth E.|Saraiya, Mona|Smith, William|Snoek, Emily",637,-1,,,,,,,-1,,-1,,,,,,,,Article,10.1097/OLQ.0000000000000659,,,,641,Clarivate Analytics Web of Science,,,,,,0148-5717,10,,,SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED DISEASES,,,,HUMAN-PAPILLOMAVIRUS VACCINATION|IMMUNIZATION PRACTICES|ADVISORY-COMMITTEE|HPV VACCINE|CHILDREN PROGRAM|RECOMMENDATIONS|GUIDELINES|PHYSICIANS|COVERAGE|OVERUSE,-1,"Haderxhanaj, Laura/0000-0002-0747-022X",,,OCT,J,2017,,,,,,Infectious Diseases,,-1,,Infectious Diseases,,0,"Cervical Cancer Screening and Prevention in 78 Sexually Transmitted Disease Clinics-United States, 2014-2015",0,,WOS:000411714900011,1,44,1537-4521,28876317,C:\Users\mginda\Desktop\agc1\wos-extract.isi,"McGinnis E, 2017, V44, P637, DOI 10.1097/OLQ.0000000000000659"
"Community health workers (CHWs) can engage elderly persons in advance care planning (ACP) conversations. We report how trained CHWs used Go Wish cards (GW (R) cards) to identify patients' highest priority preferences and evaluated whether engaging in ACP conversations was associated with subsequent health care utilization. A one-year long, pre-post longitudinal design was used to evaluate our educational intervention using mixed-methods. 392 patients (mean of 73.3 years, 82% women, 48% African American, 43% Caucasian) enrolled in the Aging Brain Care (ABC) program and participated in ACP discussions with CHWs. We expanded the role of the ABC's CHW, who work directly with individuals and caregivers during home visits to monitor bio-psycho-social needs, to include ACP conversations. The CHWs received ACP training, practice with tools such as GW (R) cards, and support from an electronic health record (EHR) clinical decision support tool. Quantitative measures of patients' ACP preferences and health care utilization were abstracted from the EHR. Qualitative data about patients' perceptions of CHWs in facilitating ACP discussions was obtained through semi-structured interviews. Eighty-six patients' data indicated that they had engaged in a preferences-for-care process using GW (R) cards. The top-three card choices by patients was attending to spirituality and religious concerns, preparing for end of life, and maintaining personal wholeness. CHWs were able to effectively engage in ACP conversations with patients and GW (R) cards were a positive way to stimulate discussion of issues previously undiscussed.",,,"Cottingham, AH|Griffin, WJ|Inui, TS|Ivy, SS|Litzelman, DK|Perkins, AJ|Schmitt-Wendholt, KM","Cottingham, Ann H.|Griffin, Wilma J.|Inui, Thomas S.|Ivy, Steven S.|Litzelman, Debra K.|Perkins, Anthony J.|Schmitt-Wendholt, Kathleen M.",926,-1,,,,,,,-1,,-1,,,,,,,,Article,10.1007/s10900-017-0336-5,,,,934,Clarivate Analytics Web of Science,,,,,,0094-5145,5,,,JOURNAL OF COMMUNITY HEALTH,,,,RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED-TRIAL|ADVANCE DIRECTIVES|ELDERLY-PATIENTS|CANCER-PATIENTS|DEMENTIA CARE|LUNG-CANCER|FAMILIES|SPIRITUALITY|MULTICENTER|DISCUSSIONS,-1,,End-of-life conversations|Clarifying end-of-life goals|Community health worker,,OCT,J,2017,,,,,,"Health Policy & Services|Public, Environmental & Occupational Health",,-1,,"Health Care Sciences & Services; Public, Environmental & Occupational Health",,1,Clarifying Values and Preferences for Care Near the End of Life: The Role of a New Lay Workforce,1,,WOS:000410472900013,1,42,1573-3610,28353007,C:\Users\mginda\Desktop\agc1\wos-extract.isi,"Litzelman DK, 2017, V42, P926, DOI 10.1007/s10900-017-0336-5"
"Recent reports support higher than expected rates of binge alcohol consumption among women and girls. Unfortunately, few studies have assessed the mechanisms underlying this pattern of intake in females. Studies in males suggest that alcohol concentrations relevant to the beginning stages of binge intoxication may selectively target tonic GABAergic inhibition mediated by GABA(A) receptor subtypes expressing the delta-subunit protein (delta-GABA(A)Rs). Indeed, administration of agonists that interact with these delta-GABA(A)Rs prior to alcohol access can abolish binge drinking behavior in male mice. These delta-GABA(A)Rs have also been shown to exhibit estrous-dependent plasticity in regions relevant to drug taking behavior, like the hippocampus and periaqueductal gray. The present experiments were designed to determine whether the estrous cycle would alter binge drinking, or our ability to modulate this pattern of alcohol use with TRIP, an agonist with high selectivity and efficacy at delta-GABA(A)Rs. Using the Drinking-in-the-Dark (DID) binge-drinking model, regularly cycling female mice were given 2 h of daily access to alcohol (20%v/v). Vaginal cytology or vaginal impedance was assessed after drinking sessions to track estrous status. There was no fluctuation in binge drinking associated with the estrous cycle. Both Intra-posterior-VTA administration of TRIP and systemic administration of the drug was also associated with an estrous cycle dependent reduction in drinking behavior. Pre-treatment with finasteride to inhibit synthesis of 5 alpha-reduced neurosteroids did not disrupt THIP's effects. Analysis of delta-subunit mRNA from posterior-VTA enriched tissue samples revealed that expression of this GABAA receptor subunit is elevated during diestrus in this region. Taken together, these studies demonstrate that delta-GABA(A)Rs in the VTA are an important target for binge drinking in females and confirm that the estrous cycle is an important moderator of the pharmacology of this GABA(A) receptor subtype.",,,"Boehm, SL|Colar, D|Melon, LC|Moore, EM|Nolan, ZT","Boehm, Stephen L., II|Colar, Delphine|Melon, Laverne C.|Moore, Eileen M.|Nolan, Zachary T.",65,-1,,,,,,,-1,,-1,,,,,,,,Article,10.1016/j.yhbeh.2017.07.015,,,,75,Clarivate Analytics Web of Science,,,,,,0018-506X,,,,HORMONES AND BEHAVIOR,,,,VENTRAL TEGMENTAL AREA|BINGE-LIKE ETHANOL|CONTAINING GABA(A) RECEPTORS|MALE C57BL/6J MICE|SITE-SPECIFIC MICROINJECTION|CYCLE-LINKED CHANGES|DELTA-SUBUNIT|GENDER-DIFFERENCES|TONIC INHIBITION|NEUROACTIVE STEROIDS,-1,"Melon, Laverne/0000-0002-2256-3707",GABA(A)|Extrasynaptic|Binge drinking|THIP|Females|Mouse|Alcohol|Delta|Tonic inhibition,,SEP,J,2017,,,,,,Behavioral Sciences|Endocrinology & Metabolism,,-1,,Behavioral Sciences; Endocrinology & Metabolism,,1,Activation of extrasynaptic delta-GABA(A) receptors globally or within the posterior-VTA has estrous-dependent effects on consumption of alcohol and estrous-independent effects on locomotion,1,,WOS:000412863500008,1,95,1095-6867,28765080,C:\Users\mginda\Desktop\agc1\wos-extract.isi,"Melon LC, 2017, V95, P65, DOI 10.1016/j.yhbeh.2017.07.015"
"Background: It is generally accepted that obesity puts patients at an increased risk for cardiovascular and respiratory complications after surgical procedures. However, in the setting of trauma, there have been mixed findings in regards to whether obesity increases the risk for additional complications. Objective: The aim of this study was to identify whether obese patients suffer an increased risk of cardiac and respiratory complications following traumatic injury. Methods: A retrospective analysis of 275,393 patients was conducted using the 2012 National Trauma Data Bank. Hierarchical regression modeling was performed to determine the probability of experiencing a cardiac or respiratory complication. Results: Patients with obesity were at a significantly higher risk of cardiac and respiratory complications compared to patients without obesity [OR: 1.81; CI: 1.72-1.91].

"Policies to remove parents' ability to opt-out from school immunization requirements on the basis of religious or personal beliefs (ie, nonmedical exemptions) may be a useful strategy to increase immunization rates and prevent outbreaks of vaccine-preventable disease. However, there is uncertainty about the effectiveness of this strategy and the range of possible outcomes. We advocate for a more deliberative process through which a broad range of outcomes is scrutinized and the balance of values underlying the policy decision to eliminate nonmedical exemptions is clearly articulated. We identify 3 outcomes that require particular consideration before policies to eliminate nonmedical exemptions are implemented widely and outline a process for making the values underlying such policies more explicit.",,,"Diekema, DS|Duchin, J|Kodish, E|Marcuse, EK|Omer, SB|Opel, DJ|Orenstein, W|Schwartz, JL|Silverman, RD","Diekema, Douglas S.|Duchin, Jeff|Kodish, Eric|Marcuse, Edgar K.|Omer, Saad B.|Opel, Douglas J.|Orenstein, Walt|Schwartz, Jason L.|Silverman, Ross D.",893,-1,,,,,,,-1,,-1,,,,,,,,Review,10.1001/jamapediatrics.2017.1868,,,,896,Clarivate Analytics Web of Science,,,,,,2168-6203,9,,,JAMA PEDIATRICS,,,,PUBLIC-HEALTH|UNITED-STATES|IMMUNIZATION|EXEMPTIONS|POLITICS|PARENTS|MEASLES|ETHICS|LAWS,-1,,,,SEP,J,2017,,,,,,Pediatrics,,-1,,Pediatrics,,3,Achieving an Optimal Childhood Vaccine Policy,3,,WOS:000410140700017,1,171,2168-6211,28672396,C:\Users\mginda\Desktop\agc1\wos-extract.isi,"Opel DJ, 2017, V171, P893, DOI 10.1001/jamapediatrics.2017.1868"

"While antidepressant use during pregnancy has been associated with adverse birth and neurodevelopmental outcomes, these associations may be attributed to confounding factors, such as genetic influences, maternal stress, or poor health practices during pregnancy. This study used 4 observational designs to investigate these associations, including sibling and paternal information. The study used multiple national Swedish registries. First-trimester exposures, defined as at least 1 dispensation between 90 days before estimated conceptions and 90 days after estimated conception, to any antidepressants and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, reported through either maternal self-report or dispensation records, were the main exposures evaluated. The main outcomes were small for gestational age, defined as birth weight less than 2 SDs below the mean for gestational age; preterm birth, defined as less than 37 gestational weeks; and diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder or attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Maternal and paternal covariates included age of childbearing, highest level of completed education, history of criminal conviction, history of psychiatric illnesses, history of suicide attempts, and country of origin (Sweden or outside Sweden). Parity and year of birth were pregnancy covariates. Population-wide baseline models were assessed adjusting only for pregnancy covariates. Then, population-wide associations were adjusted for maternal and paternal covariates as well. A third model compared exposure-and outcome-discordant offspring within families. After exclusion of multiple births, missing father identifiers, or other missing information, a final cohort of 1,580,629 offspring born to 943,776 was used. Of these, 26,477 offspring had first-trimester maternal antidepressant dispensations, 22,125 of which were selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor dispensations. Preterm births accounted for 6.98% of exposed and 4.78% of unexposed offspring. In the baseline models, first-trimester exposure was associated with all 4 outcomes (preterm birth odds ratio [OR], 1.47; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.40-1.55]; small for gestational age OR, 1.15 [95% CI, 1.06-1.25]; ADHD HR, 2.21 [95% CI, 2.04-2.39]). After adjusting for pregnancy and maternal and paternal traits and comparing sibling data, first-trimester antidepressant exposure was associated with only a small increased risk of preterm birth (OR, 1.34 [95% CI, 1.18-1.52]) and was not associated with small for gestational age (OR, 1.01 [95% CI, 0.81-1.25]), ADHD (HR, 0.99 [95% CI, 0.79-1.25]), or autism spectrum disorder (HR, 0.83 [95% CI, 0.62-1.13]). Unexposed and exposed siblings were found to be at equal risk of small for gestational age, ADHD, and autism spectrum disorder as one another, whereas exposed siblings had a slightly increased risk of preterm birth. Both autism spectrum disorder and ADHD were associated with paternal first-trimester antidepressant dispensations, supporting the idea that familial confounding may explain associations between exposure and neurodevelopmental disorders.",,,"Almqvist, C|D'Onofrio, BM|Hernandez-Diaz, S|Larsson, H|Lichtenstein, P|Oberg, AS|Quinn, PD|Rickert, ME|Sujan, AC","Almqvist, Catarina|D'Onofrio, Brian M.|Hernandez-Diaz, Sonia|Larsson, Henrik|Lichtenstein, Paul|Oberg, Anna S.|Quinn, Patrick D.|Rickert, Martin|Sujan, Ayesha C.",523,-1,,,,,,,-1,,-1,,,,,,,,Article,10.1097/01.ogx.0000524510.66825.09,,,,524,Clarivate Analytics Web of Science,,,,,,0029-7828,9,,,OBSTETRICAL & GYNECOLOGICAL SURVEY,,,,,-1,,,,SEP,J,2017,,,,,,Obstetrics & Gynecology,,-1,,Obstetrics & Gynecology,,0,"Associations of Maternal Antidepressant Use During the First Trimester of Pregnancy With Preterm Birth, Small for Gestational Age, Autism Spectrum Disorder, and Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder in Offspring",0,,WOS:000409937200005,1,72,1533-9866,,C:\Users\mginda\Desktop\agc1\wos-extract.isi,"Sujan AC, 2017, V72, P523, DOI 10.1097/01.ogx.0000524510.66825.09"
"While great progress has been made in digitizing the US health care system, today's health information technology (IT) infrastructure remains largely a collection of systems that are not designed to support a transition to value-based care. In addition, the pursuit of value-based care, in which we deliver better care with better outcomes at lower cost, places new demands on the health care system that our IT infrastructure needs to be able to support. Provider organizations pursuing new models of health care delivery and payment are finding that their electronic systems lack the capabilities needed to succeed. The result is a chasm between the current health IT ecosystem and the health IT ecosystem that is desperately needed. In this paper, we identify a set of focal goals and associated near-term achievable actions that are critical to pursue in order to enable the health IT ecosystem to meet the acute needs of modern health care delivery. These ideas emerged from discussions that occurred during the 2015 American Medical Informatics Association Policy Invitational Meeting. To illustrate the chasm and motivate our recommendations, we created a vignette from the multistakeholder perspectives of a patient, his provider, and researchers/innovators. It describes an idealized scenario in which each stakeholder's needs are supported by an integrated health IT environment. We identify the gaps preventing such a reality today and present associated policy recommendations that serve as a blueprint for critical actions that would enable us to cross the current health IT chasm by leveraging systems and information to routinely deliver high-value care.",,,"Adler-Milstein, J|Embi, PJ|Middleton, B|Sarkar, IN|Smith, J","Adler-Milstein, Julia|Embi, Peter J.|Middleton, Blackford|Sarkar, Indra Neil|Smith, Jeff",1036,-1,,,,,,,-1,,-1,,,,,,,,Review,10.1093/jamia/ocx017,,,,1043,Clarivate Analytics Web of Science,,,,,,1067-5027,5,,,JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MEDICAL INFORMATICS ASSOCIATION,,,,PRECISION MEDICINE|PARTICIPATION|BIOBANK|EHR,-1,,policy|health reform|AMIA,,SEP,J,2017,,,,,,"Computer Science, Information Systems|Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications|Health Care Sciences & Services|Information Science & Library Science|Medical Informatics",,-1,,Computer Science; Health Care Sciences & Services; Information Science & Library Science; Medical Informatics,,9,Crossing the health IT chasm: considerations and policy recommendations to overcome current challenges and enable value-based care,9,,WOS:000409183600023,1,24,1527-974X,28340128,C:\Users\mginda\Desktop\agc1\wos-extract.isi,"Adler-Milstein J, 2017, V24, P1036, DOI 10.1093/jamia/ocx017"
"Objective: Substance use disorders are major contributors to excess mortality among individuals with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), yet associations between pharmacological ADHD treatment and substance-related problems remain unclear. This study investigated concurrent and tong-term associations between ADHD medication treatment and substance-related events. Method: The authors analyzed 2005-2014 commercial health care claims from 2,993,887 (47,2% female) adolescent and adult ADHD patients. Within-individual analyses compared the risk of substance-related events (i.e., emergency department visits related to substance use disorders) during months in which patients received prescribed stimulant medication or atomoxetine relative to the risk during months in which they did not. Results: In adjusted within-individual comparisons, relative to periods in which patients did not receive ADHD medication, male patients had 35% lower odds of concurrent substance-related events when receiving medication (odds ratio=0.65, 95% CI=0.64-0.67), and female patients had 31% tower odds of concurrent substance-related events (odds ratio=0.69, 95% CI=0.67-0.71). Moreover, male patients had 19% lower odds of substance-related events 2 years after medication periods (odds ratio=0.81, 95% CI=0.78-0.85), and female patients had 14% tower odds of substance-related events 2 years after medication periods (odds ratio = 0.86, 95% CI= 0.82-0.91). Sensitivity analyses supported most findings but were less consistent for long-term associations among women. Conclusions: These results provide evidence that receiving ADHD medication is unlikely to be associated with greater risk of substance-related problems in adolescence or adulthood. Rather, medication was associated with lower concurrent risk of substance-related events and, at least among men, lower long-term risk of future substance-related events.",,,"Chang, Z|D'Onofrio, BM|Gibbons, RD|Hur, K|Lahey, BB|Larsson, H|Lichtenstein, P|Quinn, PD|Rickert, ME|Sjolander, A","Chang, Zheng|D'Onofrio, Brian M.|Gibbons, Robert D.|Hur, Kwan|Lahey, Benjamin B.|Larsson, Henrik|Lichtenstein, Paul|Quinn, Patrick D.|Rickert, Martin|Sjolander, Arvid",877,-1,,,,,,,-1,,-1,,,,,,,,Article,10.1176/appi.ajp.2017.16060686,,,,885,Clarivate Analytics Web of Science,,,,,,0002-953X,9,,,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRY,,,,ATTENTION-DEFICIT/HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER|DEFICIT-HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER|STIMULANT TREATMENT|CLINICAL-TRIAL|CHILDREN|RISK|ADOLESCENTS|METHYLPHENIDATE|METAANALYSIS|OUTCOMES,-1,,,,1-Sep,J,2017,,,,,,Psychiatry,,-1,,Psychiatry,,8,ADHD Medication and Substance-Related Problems,8,,WOS:000408892000013,1,174,1535-7228,28659039,C:\Users\mginda\Desktop\agc1\wos-extract.isi,"Quinn PD, 2017, V174, P877, DOI 10.1176/appi.ajp.2017.16060686"
"ObjectiveWe examined epidemiological associations between anorexia nervosa (AN) and bulimia nervosa (BN) and risks of committing theft and other crimes in a nationwide female population. MethodFemales born in Sweden during 1979-1998 (N=957,106) were followed from age 15 for up to 20 years using information on clinically diagnosed AN and BN (exposures), convictions of theft and other crimes (outcomes), psychiatric comorbidities, and familial relatedness from Swedish national registers. We estimated hazard ratios (HRs) of criminality in exposed versus unexposed females using Cox proportional hazards regressions and explored how comorbidities and unmeasured familial factors explained the associations. ResultsThe cumulative incidence of convictions of theft (primarily petty theft) and other crimes was higher in exposed females (AN: 11.60% theft, 7.39% other convictions; BN: 17.97% theft, 13.17% other convictions) than in unexposed females (approximate to 5% theft, approximate to 6% other convictions). The significantly increased risk of being convicted of theft in exposed females (AN: HR=2.51, 95% confidence interval=[2.29, 2.74], BN: 4.31 [3.68, 5.05]) was partially explained by comorbidities; unmeasured familial factors partially explained the association with convictions of theft in BN but not in AN. Females with BN had a doubled risk of convictions of other crimes, which was partially explained by comorbidities. DiscussionIndividuals with eating disorders had increased risk for convictions of theft and potentially other crimes. Results underscore the importance of regular forensic screening and encourage research on mechanisms underlying the relation between crime and eating disorder psychopathology and efforts to determine how best to address such relation in treatment.",,,"Almqvist, C|Bulik, CM|D'Onofrio, BM|Kuja-Halkola, R|Langstorm, N|Larsson, H|Lichtenstein, P|Norring, C|Thornton, LM|Yao, SY","Almqvist, Catarina|Bulik, Cynthia M.|D'Onofrio, Brian M.|Kuja-Halkola, Ralf|Langstorm, Niklas|Larsson, Henrik|Lichtenstein, Paul|Norring, Claes|Thornton, Laura M.|Yao, Shuyang",1095,-1,,,,,,,-1,,-1,,,,,,,,Article,10.1002/eat.22743,,,,1103,Clarivate Analytics Web of Science,,,,,,0276-3478,9,,,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EATING DISORDERS,,,,EATING-DISORDERS|ENVIRONMENTAL-INFLUENCES|CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS|PSYCHOPATHOLOGY|KLEPTOMANIA|COMORBIDITY|FACILITATORS|METAANALYSIS|BARRIERS|BEHAVIOR,-1,"Yao, Shuyang/0000-0001-9669-4470; Langstrom, Niklas/0000-0002-2686-6799",anorexia nervosa|bulimia nervosa|cohort study|crime|eating disorders|epidemiology|register-based|stealing|theft behavior,,SEP,J,2017,,,,,,"Psychology, Clinical|Nutrition & Dietetics|Psychiatry|Psychology",,-1,,Psychology; Nutrition & Dietetics; Psychiatry,,0,Risk of being convicted of theft and other crimes in anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa: A prospective cohort study in a Swedish female population,0,,WOS:000408317700011,1,50,1098-108X,28791709,C:\Users\mginda\Desktop\agc1\wos-extract.isi,"Yao SY, 2017, V50, P1095, DOI 10.1002/eat.22743"
"Numerous pharmacogenetic clinical guidelines and recommendations have been published, but barriers have hindered the clinical implementation of pharmacogenetics. The Translational Pharmacogenetics Program(TPP) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Pharmacogenomics Research Network was established in 2011 to catalog and contribute to the development of pharmacogenetic implementations at eight US healthcare systems, with the goal to disseminate realworld solutions for the barriers to clinical pharmacogenetic implementation. The TPP collected and normalized pharmacogenetic implementationmetrics through June 2015, including gene-drug pairs implemented, interpretations of alleles and diplotypes, numbers of tests performed and actionable results, and workflow diagrams. TPP participant institutions developed diverse solutions to overcome many barriers, but the use of Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC) guidelines provided some consistency among the institutions.

"Fifty percent of adolescents have tried an illicit drug and 70% have tried alcohol by the end of high school, with even higher rates among multiracial youth. Ethnic identity is a protective factor against substance use for minority groups. However, little is known about the mechanisms that facilitate its protective effects, and even less is known about this relationship for multiracial youth. The purpose of the present study was to examine the protective effect of ethnic identity on substance use and to determine whether this relationship operated indirectly through self-esteem, a strong predictor of substance use for among adolescent populations. Participants included 468 multiracial youth in grades six through 12 (53% female). The results found that ethnic identity was indeed related to substance use, partially through changes in self-esteem. Findings from this study contribute to our understanding and development of models of risk and protection for an understudied population.

"IMPORTANCE Individuals with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are at greater risk for academic problems. Pharmacologic treatment is effective in reducing the core symptoms of ADHD, but it is unclear whether it helps to improve academic outcomes. OBJECTIVE To investigate the association between the use of ADHD medication and performance on higher education entrance tests in individuals with ADHD. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This cohort study observed 61 640 individuals with a diagnosis of ADHD from January 1, 2006, to December 31, 2013. Records of their pharmacologic treatment were extracted from Swedish national registers along with data from the Swedish Scholastic Aptitude Test. Using a within-patient design, test scores when patients were taking medication for ADHD were compared with scores when they were not taking such medication. Data analysis was performed from November 24, 2015, to November 4, 2016. EXPOSURES Periods with and without ADHD medication use. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Scores from the higher education entrance examination (score range, 1-200 points). RESULTS Among 930 individuals (493 males and 437 females; mean [SD] age, 22.2 [3.2] years) who had taken multiple entrance tests (n = 2524) and used ADHD medications intermittently, the test scores were a mean of 4.80 points higher (95% CI, 2.26-7.34; P<.001) during periods they were taking medication vs nonmedicated periods, after adjusting for age and practice effects. Similar associations between ADHD medication use and test scores were detected in sensitivity analyses. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Individuals with ADHD had higher scores on the higher education entrance tests during periods they were taking ADHD medication vs nonmedicated periods. These findings suggest that ADHD medications may help ameliorate educationally relevant outcomes in individuals with ADHD.",,"Lu, Yi/G-9292-2018","Almqvist, C|Cederlof, M|D'Onofrio, BM|Larsson, H|Lichtenstein, P|Lu, Y|Sjolander, A","Almqvist, Catarina|Cederlof, Martin|D'Onofrio, Brian M.|Larsson, Henrik|Lichtenstein, Paul|Lu, Yi|Sjolander, Arvid",815,-1,,,,,,,-1,,-1,,,,,,,,Article,10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2017.1472,,,,822,Clarivate Analytics Web of Science,,,,,,2168-622X,8,,,JAMA PSYCHIATRY,,,,DEFICIT-HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER|ACADEMIC-ACHIEVEMENT|FOLLOW-UP|SCHOOL PERFORMANCE|ADULT ADHD|CHILDREN|METAANALYSIS|ADOLESCENT|IMPACT|PREVALENCE,-1,"Lu, Yi/0000-0001-9933-3654",,,AUG,J,2017,,,,,,Psychiatry,,-1,,Psychiatry,,3,Association Between Medication Use and Performance on Higher Education Entrance Tests in Individuals With Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder,4,,WOS:000406930300011,1,74,2168-6238,28658471,C:\Users\mginda\Desktop\agc1\wos-extract.isi,"Lu Y, 2017, V74, P815, DOI 10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2017.1472"

Conditional logistic regressions estimated risks for ADHD, autism, obsessive-compulsive disorder, anorexia nervosa, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, depression, substance use disorder, and violent/non-violent criminality in individuals with reading problems and their siblings. Diagnoses of psychiatric disorders were physician-assigned and ascertained from the Swedish National Patient Register, and crime convictions from the Swedish National Crime Register. We found that individuals with reading problems had excess risks for all psychiatric disorders (except anorexia nervosa) and criminality, with risk ratios between 1.34 and 4.91. Siblings of individuals with reading problems showed excess risks for ADHD, autism, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, depression, substance use disorder, and non-violent criminality, with risk ratios between 1.14 and 1.70. In summary, individuals with reading problems had increased risks of virtually all psychiatric disorders, and criminality. The origin of most of these overlaps was familial, in that siblings of individuals with reading problems also had elevated risks of ADHD, autism, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, depression, substance use disorder, and non-violent criminality. These findings have implications for gene-searching efforts, and suggest that health care practitioners should be alert for signs of psychiatric disorders in families where reading problems exist.

"Ethnic identity is an important buffer against drug use among minority youth. However, limited work has examined pathways through which ethnic identity mitigates risk. School-aged youth (N = 34,708; 52 % female) of diverse backgrounds (i.e., African American (n = 5333), Asian (n = 392), Hispanic (n = 662), Multiracial (n = 2129), Native American (n = 474), and White (n = 25718) in grades 4-12 provided data on ethnic identity, drug attitudes, and drug use. After controlling for gender and grade, higher ethnic identity was associated with lower past month drug use for African American, Hispanic, and Multiracial youth. Conversely, high ethnic identity was associated with increased risk for White youth. An indirect pathway between ethnic identity, drug attitudes, and drug use was also found for African American, Hispanic, and Asian youth. Among White youth the path model was also significant, but in the opposite direction. These findings confirm the importance of ethnic identity for most minority youth. Further research is needed to better understand the association between ethnic identity and drug use for Multiracial and Hispanic youth, best ways to facilitate healthy ethnic identity development for minority youth, and how to moderate the risk of identity development for White youth.",,,"Banks, DE|Barnes-Najor, J|Fisher, S|Hensel, DJ|Zapolski, TCB","Banks, Devin E.|Barnes-Najor, Jessica|Fisher, Sycarah|Hensel, Devon J.|Zapolski, Tamika C.

"BACKGROUND: Persons with neuropsychiatric disorders are at increased risk of suicide, but there is little data concerning Tourette's and chronic tic disorders (TD/CTD). We aimed to quantify the risk of suicidal behavior in a large nationwide cohort of patients with TD/CTD, establish the contribution of psychiatric comorbidity to this risk, and identify predictors of suicide. METHODS: Using a validated algorithm, we identified 7736 TD/CTD cases in the Swedish National Patient Register during a 44-year period (1969-2013). Using a matched case-cohort design, patients were compared with general population control subjects (1: 10 ratio). Risk of suicidal behavior was estimated using conditional logistic regressions. Predictors of suicidal behavior in the TD/CTD cohort were studied using Cox regression models. RESULTS: In unadjusted models, TD/CTD patients, compared with control subjects, had an increased risk of both dying by suicide (odds ratio: 4.39; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.89-6.67) and attempting suicide (odds ratio: 3.86; 95% CI: 3.50-4.26). After adjusting for psychiatric comorbidities, the risk was reduced but remained substantial. Persistence of tics beyond young adulthood and a previous suicide attempt were the strongest predictors of death by suicide in TD/CTD patients (hazard ratio: 11.39; 95% CI: 3.71-35.02, and hazard ratio: 5.65; 95% CI: 2.21-14.42, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: TD/CTD are associated with substantial risk of suicide. Suicidal behavior should be monitored in these patients, particularly in those with persistent tics, history of suicide attempts, and psychiatric comorbidities. Preventive and intervention strategies aimed to reduce the suicidal risk in this group are warranted.",,"Rosenqvist, Mina/P-6531-2018","Brander, G|D'Onofrio, BM|Fernandez de la Cruz, L|Larsson, H|Lichtenstein, P|Mataix-Cols, D|Ruck, C|Runeson, B|Rydell, M","Brander, Gustaf|D'Onofrio, Brian M.|Fernandez de la Cruz, Lorena|Larsson, Henrik|Lichtenstein, Paul|Mataix-Cols, David|Ruck, Christian|Runeson, Bo|Rydell, Mina",111,-1,,,,,,,-1,,-1,,,,,,,,Article,10.1016/j.biopsych.2016.08.023,,,,118,Clarivate Analytics Web of Science,,,,,,0006-3223,2,,,BIOLOGICAL PSYCHIATRY,,,,POPULATION-BASED COHORT|PREVALENCE|DEPRESSION|YOUTH|ASSOCIATIONS|METAANALYSIS|COMORBIDITY|ADOLESCENT|BEHAVIORS|IDEATION,-1,"Rosenqvist, Mina/0000-0002-2788-2061",Chronic tic disorder|Premature mortality|Psychiatric epidemiology|Suicide|Suicide attempt|Tourette's disorder,,15-Jul,J,2017,,,,,,Neurosciences|Psychiatry,,-1,,Neurosciences & Neurology; Psychiatry,,1,Suicide in Tourette's and Chronic Tic Disorders,1,,WOS:000403670500007,1,82,1873-2402,27773353,C:\Users\mginda\Desktop\agc1\wos-extract.isi,"Fernandez de la Cruz L, 2017, V82, P111, DOI 10.1016/j.biopsych.2016.08.023"
"The purpose of this study was to engage patients with heart failure (HF) to assess if changes are needed in a research study design, methods and outcomes when transferring interventions used in urban/community hospitals to rural hospital settings. A qualitative structured interview was conducted with eight patients with a diagnosis of HF admitted to two rural hospitals. Patients validated the study design, measures and outcomes, but identified one area that should be added to the study protocol, symptom experience. Results validated that the intervention, methods and outcomes for the planned study were important, but modifications to the study protocol resulted.

"Background: Pediatric surgery is one of the most difficult surgical fellowships to obtain. It requires stellar academic credentials and, often, dedicated time pursuing research. It is unknown, however, if pediatric surgeons maintain high academic output as faculty members. We hypothesized that the majority of pediatric surgeons do not pursue robust research activities as faculty, and therefore, over time, their academic productivity decreases. Methods: Numbers of publications, citations, H-index, and NIH funding rates were determined for 4354 surgical faculty at the top-55 NIH based departments of surgery using websites, Scopus, NIH RePORTER, and Grantome. Continuous variables were compared with ANOVA and post-hoc Bonferroni; categorical variables by chi(2) test. p < 0.05 was significant. Results: In this dataset, 321 pediatric surgery (PS) faculty represented 7.4% of the cohort. Among PS faculty, 31% were assistant professors, 24% associate professors, 31% full professors and 13% had no academic rank. PS faculty had significantly more publications, a higher H index, and more high level NIH funding early in their careers at the assistant professor level compared to general surgeons. PS faculty at the associate professor level had equivalent high level NIH funding, but lower recentness and academic power compared to general surgeons. Professors of PS rebounded slightly, with only observed deficiencies in number of citations compared to general surgeons. Conclusions: PS faculty in assistant professor ranks has higher scholarly productivity compared to equivalently ranked general surgeons. Despite some mild academic setbacks in midcareer, pediatric surgeons are able to maintain similar academic productivity to their general surgery colleagues by the time they are full professors.

"The current study examined associations between labor induction and both (1) offspring attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) diagnosis in a Swedish birth cohort born 1992-2005 (n = 1,085,008) and (2) indices of offspring low academic achievement in a sub-cohort born 1992-1997 (n = 489,196). Associations were examined in the entire sample (i.e., related and unrelated individuals) with adjustment for measured covariates and, in order to account for unmeasured confounders shared within families, within differentially exposed cousins and siblings. We observed an association between labor induction and offspring ADHD diagnosis and low academic achievement in the population. However, these associations were fully attenuated after adjusting for measured covariates and unmeasured factors that cousins and siblings share. The results suggest that observed associations between labor induction and ADHD and low academic achievement may be due to genetic and/or shared environmental factors that influence both mothers' risk of labor induction and offspring neurodevelopment.",,,"Almqvist, C|Bateman, BT|D'Onofrio, BM|Hernandez-Diaz, S|Larsson, H|Lichtenstein, P|Oberg, AS|Rickert, ME|Wiggs, KK","Almqvist, Catarina|Bateman, Brian T.|D'Onofrio, Brian M.|Hernandez-Diaz, Sonia|Larsson, Henrik|Lichtenstein, Paul|Oberg, Anna S.|Rickert, Martin|Wiggs, Kelsey K.",383,-1,,,,,,,-1,,-1,,,,,,,,Article,10.1007/s10519-017-9852-4,,,,393,Clarivate Analytics Web of Science,,,,,,0001-8244,4,,,BEHAVIOR GENETICS,,,,GESTATIONAL DIABETES-MELLITUS|DEFICIT/HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER|CESAREAN DELIVERY|MATERNAL SMOKING|NULLIPAROUS WOMEN|RISK-FACTORS|PREGNANCY|AUTISM|OXYTOCIN|PREECLAMPSIA,-1,,Labor induction|Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder|Academic achievement|Family studies|Sibling comparison|Cousin comparison,,JUL,J,2017,,,,,,"Behavioral Sciences|Genetics & Heredity|Psychology, Multidisciplinary",,-1,,Behavioral Sciences; Genetics & Heredity; Psychology,,0,A Family-Based Study of the Association Between Labor Induction and Offspring Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder and Low Academic Achievement,0,,WOS:000403569500002,1,47,1573-3297,28551761,C:\Users\mginda\Desktop\agc1\wos-extract.isi,"Wiggs KK, 2017, V47, P383, DOI 10.1007/s10519-017-9852-4"

Juvenile probation is the most common disposition in the justice system and juvenile probation officers (JPOs) are crucial for connecting justice-involved youth with appropriate care. We examined the role of mental health competency on the use of self-report case management strategy types (deterrence, restorative justice, and treatment) by JPOs and whether jurisdiction-level differences were relevant. Results suggest that mental health competency predicted use of restorative justice and treatment strategies and all three strategy types varied at the county level.

"Background. A key principle of patient-centred outcomes research (PCOR) is the engagement of patients and other stakeholders in the research process, but the evidence is still emerging on the impact patient engagement has on the research process. A 10-step framework has been developed to provide methodological guidance for patient engagement throughout the research process. However, the utility of the framework for patient engagement has not been tested in actual research studies. Objective. To describe researcher's overall experiences with engaging patients at the beginning of their PCOR research process. Methods. Twelve in-depth interviews were conducted face-to-face and by telephone with PCOR researchers between November 2014 and January 2015 at an Academic Health Center in the eastern USA. All data were audiotaped and transcribed, and NVivo 10 software was used for data analysis. Results. Four major themes emerged (i) the importance of patient engagement and how it provides 'a perspective you can't get unless you talk to the patient'; (ii) the impact of patient engagement; (iii) challenges and barriers of engagement; and (iv) the realities of patient engagement. Conclusions. Researchers' views illustrate the need to re-evaluate patient engagement in PCOR based on current realities. Given the many challenges to engagement that researchers encounter, it may be more productive to redefine the process of patient engagement so that the issues researchers now face are taken into account in future funding announcements, engagement rubrics and methodology frameworks developed.",,,"Huang, JC|Lavallee, DC|Mullins, D|Newhouse, RP|Sofolahan-Oladeinde, Y","Huang, Jennifer C.|Lavallee, Danielle C.|Mullins, Daniel|Newhouse, Robin P.|Sofolahan-Oladeinde, Yewande",272,-1,,,,,,,-1,,-1,,,,,,,,Article,10.1093/fampra/cmx013,,,,277,Clarivate Analytics Web of Science,,,,,,0263-2136,3,,,FAMILY PRACTICE,,,,STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT,-1,"Mullins, C.

"BackgroundAmong general population studies, lower rates of binge drinking tend to be found among African Americans and Hispanics compared to Whites. However, among older adult populations, minority groups have been shown to be at higher risk for binge drinking, suggesting the presence of a crossover effect from low to high risk as a function of age. To date, limited research has examined the crossover effect among African American and Hispanic populations compared to non-Hispanic Whites across large developmental time frames or explored variation in risk based on income or gender. This study aimed to fill these gaps in the literature. MethodsData were compiled from the 2010 to 2013 National Survey on Drug Use and Health surveys, which provide annual, nationally representative data on substance use behaviors among individuals aged 12 and older. Hispanic, non-Hispanic African American, and non-Hispanic White respondents were included (N=205,198) in the analyses. ResultsA crossover effect was found for African American males and females among the lowest income level (i.e., incomes less than $20,000). Specifically, after controlling for education and marital status, compared to Whites, risk for binge drinking was lower for African American males at ages 18 to 24 and for females at ages 18 to 34, but higher for both African American males and females at ages 50 to 64. No crossover effect was found for Hispanic respondents. ConclusionsAlthough African Americans are generally at lower risk for binge drinking, risk appears to increase disproportionately with age among those who are impoverished. Explanatory factors, such as social determinants of health prevalent within low-income African American communities (e.g., lower education, violence exposure, housing insecurity) and potential areas for intervention programming are discussed.",,,"Baldwin, P|Banks, DE|Stump, TE|Zapolski, TCB","Baldwin, Patrick|Banks, Devin E.|Stump, Timothy E.|Zapolski, Tamika C.

"IMPORTANCE Several recent population-based studies have linked exposure to maternal smoking during pregnancy to increased risk of severe mental illness in offspring (eg, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia). It is not yet clear, however, whether this association results from causal teratogenic effects or from confounding influences shared by smoking and severe mental illness. OBJECTIVE To examine the association between smoking during pregnancy and severe mental illness in offspring, adjusting for measured covariates and unmeasured confounding using family-based designs. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This study analyzed population register data through December 31, 2013, for a cohort of 1 680 219 individuals born in Sweden from January 1, 1983, to December 31, 2001. Associations between smoking during pregnancy and severe mental illness in offspring were estimated with adjustment for measured covariates. Cousins and siblings who were discordant on smoking during pregnancy and severe mental illness were then compared, which helped to account for unmeasured genetic and environmental confounding by design. EXPOSURES Maternal self-reported smoking during pregnancy, obtained from antenatal visits. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Severe mental illness, with clinical diagnosis obtained from inpatient and outpatient visits and defined using International Classification of Diseases codes for bipolar disorder and schizophrenia spectrum disorders. RESULTS Of the 1 680 219 offspring included in the analysis, 816 775 (48.61%) were female. At the population level, offspring exposed to moderate and high levels of smoking during pregnancy had greater severe mental illness rates than did unexposed offspring (moderate smoking during pregnancy: hazard ratio [HR], 1.25; 95% CI, 1.19-1.30; high smoking during pregnancy: HR, 1.51; 95% CI, 1.44-1.59). These associations decreased in strength with increasing statistical and methodologic controls for familial confounding. In sibling comparisons with within-family covariates, associations were substantially weaker and nonsignificant (moderate smoking during pregnancy: HR, 1.09; 95% CI, 0.94-1.26; high smoking during pregnancy: HR, 1.14; 95% CI, 0.96-1.35). The pattern of associations was consistent across subsets of severe mental illness disorders and was supported by further sensitivity analyses. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE This population-and family-based study failed to find support for a causal effect of smoking during pregnancy on risk of severe mental illness in offspring.

"IMPORTANCE Motor vehicle crashes (MVCs) are a major public health problem. Research has demonstrated that individuals with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are more likely to experience MVCs, but the effect of ADHD medication treatment on the risk of MVCs remains unclear. OBJECTIVE To explore associations between ADHD medication use and risk of MVCs in a large cohort of patients with ADHD. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS For this study, a US national cohort of patients with ADHD (n = 2 319 450) was identified from commercial health insurance claims between January 1, 2005, and December 31, 2014, and followed up for emergency department visits for MVCs. The study used within-individual analyses to compare the risk of MVCs during months in which patients received ADHD medication with the risk of MVCs during months in which they did not receive ADHD medication. EXPOSURES Dispensed prescription of ADHD medications. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Emergency department visits for MVCs. RESULTS Among 2 319 450 patients identified with ADHD, the mean (SD) age was 32.5 (12.8) years, and 51.7% were female. In the within-individual analyses, male patients with ADHD had a 38%(odds ratio, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.56-0.67) lower risk of MVCs in months when receiving ADHD medication compared with months when not receiving medication, and female patients had a 42%(odds ratio, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.53-0.62) lower risk of MVCs in months when receiving ADHD medication. Similar reductions were found across all age groups, across multiple sensitivity analyses, and when considering the long-term association between ADHD medication use and MVCs. Estimates of the population-attributable fraction suggested that up to 22.1% of the MVCs in patients with ADHD could have been avoided if they had received medication during the entire follow-up. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among patients with ADHD, rates of MVCs were lower during periods when they received ADHD medication. Considering the high prevalence of ADHD and its association with MVCs, these findings warrant attention to this prevalent and preventable cause of mortality and morbidity.",,,"Chang, Z|D'Onofrio, BM|Gibbons, RD|Hur, K|Larsson, H|Quinn, PD|Sjolander, A","Chang, Zheng|D'Onofrio, Brian M.|Gibbons, Robert D.|Hur, Kwan|Larsson, Henrik|Quinn, Patrick D.|Sjolander, Arvid",597,-1,,,,,,,-1,,-1,,,,,,,,Article,10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2017.0659,,,,603,Clarivate Analytics Web of Science,,,,,,2168-622X,6,,,JAMA PSYCHIATRY,,,,DEFICIT HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER|STIMULANT MEDICATION|DRIVING PERFORMANCE|NATIONAL PREVALENCE|UNITED-STATES|ADHD|ADULTS|METAANALYSIS|ACCIDENTS|COUNTRIES,-1,,,,JUN,J,2017,,,,,,Psychiatry,,-1,,Psychiatry,,16,Association Between Medication Use for Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder and Risk of Motor Vehicle Crashes,16,,WOS:000402867200011,1,74,2168-6238,28492937,C:\Users\mginda\Desktop\agc1\wos-extract.isi,"Chang Z, 2017, V74, P597, DOI 10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2017.0659"
"A significant proportion of youth engage in health risk behaviors, which are of concern, as they are associated with adverse health consequences across development. Two factors associated with engagement in such behaviors are emotion dysregulation and impulsivity. Dialectical behavioral therapy (DBT) is an effective intervention that enhances emotion regulation skills to reduce problem behaviors among adolescent populations; however, limited research has been conducted implementing the program within school settings. The current study was a 9-week DBT skills group conducted among 80 middle school youth, with pre-posttest data among 53 students. Findings indicated feasibility to implement the program in schools and preliminary evidence of efficacy in decreasing youth's likelihood to engage in risky, particularly among youth high on an emotion-based impulsivity trait.

"The study sought to examine indigenous adolescents' suicidal behaviors and risk factors in a nationally representative sample and explore potential causes of disparities. The study analyzed the 1991-2013 Youth Risk Behavior Survey National Combined Datasets. Suicidal behavior outcomes included suicide consideration, planning, and attempts during the past 12 months. Logit regressions were used to estimate the effects of potential suicide risk factors on these suicidal behaviors. The results showed that a high percentage of indigenous adolescents exhibited suicidal behaviors (consideration: 24.6 %; planning: 20.7 %; attempts: 16.2 %). After adjusting for risk factors, indigenous adolescents were no more likely than other adolescents to consider or plan for suicide (consideration: OR 1.18, CI 0.96-1.45, p = 0.125; planning: OR 1.16, CI 0.95-1.42, p = 0.156); however, they remained significantly more likely to have made suicide attempts (OR 1.73, CI 1.32-2.26, p < 0.001).

"BACKGROUND Globalization has increased the demand for international experiences in medical education. International experiences improve medical knowledge, clinical skills, and self-development; influence career objectives; and provide insights on ethical and societal issues. However, global health rotations can end up being no more than tourism if not structured to foster personal transformation and global citizenship. OBJECTIVE We conducted a qualitative assessment of trainee-reported critical incidents to more deeply understand the impact of our global health experience on trainees. METHODS A cross-sectional survey was administered to trainees who had participated in a 2-month elective in Kenya from January 1989 to May 2013. We report the results of a qualitative assessment of the critical incident reflections participants (n = 137) entered in response to the prompt, ""Write about one of your most memorable experiences and explain why you chose to describe this particular one."" Qualitative analyses were conducted using thematic analysis and crystallization immersion analytic methods based on the principles of grounded theory, employing a constructivists' research paradigm. FINDINGS Four major themes emerged. These themes were Opening Oneself to a Broader World View; Impact of Suffering and Death; Life-Changing Experiences; and Commitment to Care for the Medically Underserved. CONCLUSIONS Circumstances that learners encounter in the resource-scarce environment in Kenya are eye-opening and life-changing. When exposed to these frame-shifting circumstances, students elaborate on or transform existing points of view. These emotionally disruptive experiences in an international health setting allowed students to enter a transformational learning process with a global mind. Students can see the world as an interdependent society and develop the capacity to advance both their enlightened self-interest and the interest of people elsewhere in the world as they mature as global citizens. Medical schools are encouraged to foster these experiences by finding ways to integrate them into curriculum.",,,"Ayuo, PO|Einterz, RM|Gardner, A|Huskins, JC|Inui, TS|Litzelman, DK|Owiti, P|Schmitt-Wendholt, KM|Stone, GS|Umoren, RA|Wambui, C","Ayuo, Paul O.|Einterz, Robert M.|Gardner, Adrian|Huskins, Jordan C.|Inui, Thomas S.|Litzelman, Debra K.|Owiti, Philip|Schmitt-Wendholt, Kathleen M.|Stone, Geren S.|Umoren, Rachel A.|Wambui, Charity",596,-1,,,,,,,-1,,-1,,,,,,,,Article,10.1016/j.aogh.2017.07.005,,,,604,Clarivate Analytics Web of Science,,,,,,2214-9996,4-Mar,,,ANNALS OF GLOBAL HEALTH,,,,INTERNATIONAL HEALTH,-1,,global health|global health experience|medical education|student experience|training,,MAY-AUG,J,2017,,,,,,"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health",,-1,,"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health",,0,On Becoming a Global Citizen: Transformative Learning Through Global Health Experiences,0,,WOS:000417209100022,1,83,,29221534,C:\Users\mginda\Desktop\agc1\wos-extract.isi,"Litzelman DK, 2017, V83, P596, DOI 10.1016/j.aogh.2017.07.005"

"BACKGROUND Injury can greatly impact patients' long-term quality of life. Resilience refers to an individual's ability to positively adapt after facing stress or trauma. The objective of this study was to examine the relationship between preinjury resiliency scores and quality of life after injury. METHODS Two hundred twenty-five adults admitted with an Injury Severity Score greater than 10 but without neurologic injury were included. The 36-item Short Form was administered at the time of admission and repeated at 1 month, 2 months, 4 months, and 12 months after injury. The Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale was completed at admission and scores were categorized into high resiliency or not high resiliency. Group-based trajectory modeling was used to identify distinct recovery trajectories for physical component scores (PCS) and mental component scores (MCS) of the 36-item Short Form. Multinomial logistic regression was used to determine whether baseline resiliency scores were predictive of PCS and MCS recovery trajectories. RESULTS Age, race, sex, mechanism of injury, Charlson Comorbidity Index, Injury Severity Score, presence of hypotension on admission, and insurance status were not associated with high resiliency. Compared with those who made less than US $10,000 per year, those who made more than US $50,000 per year had higher odds of being in the high resilience group (odds ratio, 10.92; 95% confidence interval, 2.58-46.32). Three PCS and 5 MCS trajectories were identified. There was no relationship between resilience and PCS trajectory. However, patients with high resiliency scores were 85% less likely to belong to trajectory 1, the trajectory that had the lowest mental health scores over the course of the study. Follow-up for the study was 93.8% for month 1, 82.7% for month 2, 69.4% for month 4, and 63.6% for month 12. CONCLUSION Patient resiliency predicts quality of life after injury in regards to mental health with over 25% of patients suffering poor mental health outcome trajectories. Efforts to teach resiliency skills to injured patients could improve long-term mental health for injured patients. Trauma centers are well positioned to carry out such interventions.

"Background: All-cause 30-day hospital readmission is a heart failure (HF) quality of care metric. Readmission costs the healthcare system $30.7 million annually. Specific structure, process, or patient factors that predispose patients to readmission are unclear. Objective: The aim of this study is to determine whether the addition of unit-level structural factors (attending medical service, patient-to-nurse ratio, and unit HF volume) predicts readmission beyond patient factors. Methods: A retrospective chart review of 425 patients who resided in Maryland and were discharged home in 2011 with the primary diagnosis of HF from a large, urban academic center was conducted. Results: The patients were predominately (66.6%) black/African American, with mean (SD) age of 62.2 (14.8) years. Men represented 48.2% of the sample; 32% had nonischemic HF, 31.3% had preserved ejection fractions, 25.4% had implantable cardioverter defibrillators, and 15.3% had permanent pacemakers. Average length of stay was 6.0 days. All-cause 30-day hospital readmission rate was 20.2%. Inpatient unit HF discharge volume significantly predicted readmission after controlling for patient factors. Conclusions: The study found that discharge from inpatient units with higher HF discharge volume was associated with increased risk of readmission. The findings suggest that in caring for patients with severe HF, inpatient unit HF discharge volume may negatively impact care processes, increasing the odds of hospital readmission. It is unclear what specific care processes are responsible. The discharge period is a vulnerable point in care transition that warrants further investigation.",,,"Akintade, B|Dordunoo, D|Friedmann, E|Newhouse, RP|Russell, SD|Thomas, SA","Akintade, Bim|Dordunoo, Dzifa|Friedmann, Erika|Newhouse, Robin P.|Russell, Stuart D.|Thomas, Sue A.",218,-1,,,,,,,-1,,-1,,,,,,,,Article,10.1097/JCN.0000000000000331,,,,225,Clarivate Analytics Web of Science,,,,,,0889-4655,3,,,JOURNAL OF CARDIOVASCULAR NURSING,,,,NURSING PRACTICE ENVIRONMENT|QUALITY-OF-CARE|ASSOCIATION|MORTALITY|OUTCOMES|IMPACT|PROGRAM|STAY,-1,,all-cause 30-day readmission|heart failure|hospital readmission|predictors,,MAY-JUN,J,2017,,,,,,Cardiac & Cardiovascular Systems|Nursing,,-1,,Cardiovascular System & Cardiology; Nursing,,1,Inpatient Unit Heart Failure Discharge Volume Predicts All-cause 30-Day Hospital Readmission,1,,WOS:000399380700009,1,32,1550-5049,27028590,C:\Users\mginda\Desktop\agc1\wos-extract.isi,"Dordunoo D, 2017, V32, P218, DOI 10.1097/JCN.0000000000000331"
"Objective: The aim of this study was to compare the outcomes of simultaneous and delayed implantation of kidney grafts in combined liver-kidney transplantation (CLKT). Background Data: Delayed function of the renal graft (DGF), which can result from hypotension and pressor use related to the liver transplantation (LT), may cause worse outcomes in CLKT. Methods: A total of 130 CLKTs were performed at Indiana University between 2002 and 2015 and studied in an observational cohort study. All kidneys underwent continuous hypothermic pulsatile machine perfusion until transplant: 69 with simultaneous kidney transplantation (KT) (at time of LT, group 1) and 61 with delayed KT (performed at a later time as a second operation, group 2). All patients received continuous veno-venous hemodialysis during the LT. Propensity score match analysis in a 1: 1 case-match was performed. Results: Mean kidney cold ischemia time was 10 +/-3 and 50 +/-15 hours, for groups 1 and 2 (P < 0.0001), respectively. The rate of DGF was 7.3% in group 1, but no DGF was seen in group 2 (P = 0.0600). Kidney function was significantly better in group 2, if the implantation of kidneys was delayed > 48 hours (P< 0.01). Patient survival was greater in group 2 at 1 year (91%), and 5 year (87%) post-transplantation (P = 0.0019). On multivariate analysis, DGF [hazard ratio (HR), 165.7; 95% confidence interval (CI), 9.4-2926], extended criteria donor kidneys (HR, 15.9; 95% CI 1.8-145.2), and recipient hepatitis C (HR, 5.5; 95% CI 1.7-17.8) were significant independent risk factors for patient survival.

"IMPORTANCE Prenatal antidepressant exposure has been associated with adverse outcomes. Previous studies, however, may not have adequately accounted for confounding. OBJECTIVE To evaluate alternative hypotheses for associations between first-trimester antidepressant exposure and birth and neurodevelopmental problems. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This retrospective cohort study included Swedish offspring born between 1996 and 2012 and followed up through 2013 or censored by death or emigration. Analyses controlling for pregnancy, maternal and paternal covariates, as well as sibling comparisons, timing of exposure comparisons, and paternal comparisons, were used to examine the associations. EXPOSURES Maternal self-reported first-trimester antidepressant use and first-trimester antidepressant dispensations. MAINOUTCOMES AND MEASURES Pretermbirth (<37 gestational weeks), small for gestational age (birth weight <2 SDs below the mean for gestational age), and first inpatient or outpatient clinical diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder in offspring. RESULTS Among 1 580 629 offspring (mean gestational age, 279 days; 48.6% female; 1.4% [n = 22 544] with maternal first-trimester self-reported antidepressant use) born to 943 776 mothers (mean age at childbirth, 30 years), 6.98% of exposed vs 4.78% of unexposed offspring were preterm, 2.54% of exposed vs 2.19% of unexposed were small for gestational age, 5.28% of exposed vs 2.14% of unexposed were diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder by age 15 years, and 12.63% of exposed vs 5.46% of unexposed were diagnosed with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder by age 15 years. At the population level, first-trimester exposure was associated with all outcomes compared with unexposed offspring (preterm birth odds ratio [OR], 1.47 [95% CI, 1.40-1.55]; small for gestational age OR, 1.15 [95% CI, 1.06-1.25]; autism spectrum disorder hazard ratio [HR], 2.02 [95% CI, 1.80-2.26]; attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder HR, 2.21 [95% CI, 2.04-2.39]). However, in models that compared siblings while adjusting for pregnancy, maternal, and paternal traits, first-trimester antidepressant exposure was associated with preterm birth (OR, 1.34 [95% CI, 1.18-1.52]) but not with small for gestational age (OR, 1.01 [95% CI, 0.81-1.25]), autism spectrum disorder (HR, 0.83 [95% CI, 0.62-1.13]), or attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (HR, 0.99 [95% CI, 0.79-1.25]). Results from analyses assessing associations with maternal dispensations before pregnancy and with paternal first-trimester dispensations were consistent with findings from the sibling comparisons.

Objective/Study design The purpose of this study was to determine the concordance of Pediatric Health Information System ( PHIS) perioperative antibiotic charges with the institution's medication administration data for males <10 years old and who underwent outpatient penile/inguinal procedures from July 2013 to March 2015. Results There was 93.9% positive and negative agreement between perioperative antibiotic charges versus administration. The sensitivity and specificity were 96.8% and 87.2%, respectively. The positive and negative predictive values were 94.6% and 92.2%, respectively.

"We examined potential predictors of initial court agreement and 1-year relitigation in a sample of contested paternity cases involving unmarried parents coming to court to establish paternity, child support, and other issues. Cases participated in an RCT of a parent program and of a waiting period between establishment of paternity and court hearing. We controlled for RCT study factors and used baseline assessment data to predict likelihood of reaching full agreement in the initial court hearing and relitigation in the following year. Findings suggest that cases in which parents get along better outside of court are more likely to reach agreement and less likely to return to court. Additionally, particular parent demographics predict lower likelihood of reaching initial agreement (e.g., parents are non-White, father earns below $10,000 yearly), more relitigation (e.g., parents are non-White, mother earns above $10,000 yearly, father has children with others), and less relitigation (e.g., father earns above $10,000 yearly). Child demographics and most parent relationship characteristics did not predict outcomes. We discuss findings and offer suggestions for court interventions. Key Points for the Family Court Community: To gain insight into potential predictors of court outcomes of an understudied, though growing and likely high- risk, subgroup of American families To begin to identify individual- and case-level predictors that may allow us to better understand which families are best served and which tend to struggle As this study was the first to consider predictors of court outcomes in a Title IV-D contested paternity sample, all findings require replication before family courts and legal professionals can use them to make court intervention decisions",,,"Applegate, AG|D'Onofrio, BM|Holtzworth-Munroe, A|Poladian, AR|Rudd, BN","Applegate, Amy G.|D'Onofrio, Brian M.|Holtzworth-Munroe, Amy|Poladian, Ani R.|Rudd, Brittany N.",243,-1,,,,,,,-1,,-1,,,,,,,,Article,10.1111/fcre.12275,,,,259,Clarivate Analytics Web of Science,,,,,,1531-2445,2,,,FAMILY COURT REVIEW,,,,PARTNERSHIP INSTABILITY|DIVORCE|MEDIATION|CHILDREN|PARENTS|INVOLVEMENT|ADJUSTMENT|RACE,-1,,Contested Paternity|Family Court Outcomes|Initial Agreement|Interparental Conflict|Predictors|Relitigation|Title IV-D|and Unmarried Parents,,APR,J,2017,,,,,,Law,,-1,,Government & Law,,0,PREDICTORS OF INITIAL COURT AGREEMENT AND 1-YEAR RELITIGATION IN TITLE IV-D CONTESTED PATERNITY CASES,0,,WOS:000399353000006,1,55,1744-1617,,C:\Users\mginda\Desktop\agc1\wos-extract.isi,"Poladian AR, 2017, V55, P243, DOI 10.1111/fcre.12275"
"Despite a lack of research on parent programs for separating unmarried parents, many judicial officers mandate participation. Rudd, Holtzworth-Munroe, Reyome, Applegate, and D'Onofrio (2015) conducted the only randomized controlled trial of any online parent program for separating parents, ProudToParent. org (PTP), and related court processes (e.g., having a waiting period between the establishment of paternity and the court hearing regarding child related issues vs. having the hearing the same day). They recruited a unique sample of 182 cases in a Title IV-D Court (i.e., a court for primarily low income parents) (Authorization of Appropriations, 42 U.S.C. 651, 2013), in which paternity was previously contested but subsequently established via court-ordered genetic testing. Unexpectedly, cases assigned to PTP and a waiting period were the least likely to reach agreement at their court hearing. In the current study, we extend these results to examine the impact of the study conditions on relitigation in the year following the court hearing; only 11.2% of cases filed a motion, and 7.8% had a hearing. The group that was least likely to reach full initial agreement (i.e., assigned to PTP and the waiting period) were the most likely to relitigate. Further, controlling for study conditions, reaching a full agreement in the Title IV-D court decreased the odds of having a court hearing in the following year. Reaching agreements on the specific issues involved in such cases (e.g., custody, child support) reduced the likelihood of both motions and hearings in the year after the Title IV-D hearings. The implications of these findings are discussed.",,,"Applegate, AG|D'Onofrio, BM|Holtzworth-Munroe, A|Poladian, AR|Rudd, BN","Applegate, Amy G.|D'Onofrio, Brian M.|Holtzworth-Munroe, Amy|Poladian, Ani R.|Rudd, Brittany N.",381,-1,,,,,,,-1,,-1,,,,,,,,Article,10.1037/fam0000255,,,,386,Clarivate Analytics Web of Science,,,,,,0893-3200,3,,,JOURNAL OF FAMILY PSYCHOLOGY,,,,FAMILIES|DIVORCE,-1,,online parent program|unmarried parents|Title IV-D|relitigation|RCT|follow-up,,APR,J,2017,,,,,,"Psychology, Clinical|Family Studies",,-1,,Psychology; Family Studies,,0,Randomized Control Trial Follow-Up: Online Program and Waiting Period for Unmarried Parents in Title IV-D Court,0,,WOS:000398937000014,1,31,1939-1293,27808522,C:\Users\mginda\Desktop\agc1\wos-extract.isi,"Rudd BN, 2017, V31, P381, DOI 10.1037/fam0000255"
"OBJECTIVE The aim of this study was to describe the infrastructures supporting research in Magnet (R) hospitals. BACKGROUND Hospitals undertaking the journey toward Magnet designation must build research and evidence-based practice (EBP) infrastructures that support the infusion of research and EBP into clinical practice. METHODS An electronic survey was developed and distributed to the chief nursing officer or Magnet coordinator of all Magnet hospitals between June 10, 2015, and July 8, 2015. RESULTS Of the 418 Magnet hospitals invited, 249 responses (60%) were received. Resources dedicated to nursing research were difficult to isolate from those for EBP. Supporting clinical nurses' time away from the bedside remains a challenge. Nearly half (44%) indicated that research is conducted within the nurses' usual clinical hours, and 40% indicated that nurses participate on their own time. CONCLUSIONS Hospitals use a variety of resources and mentor arrangements to support research and EBP, often the same resources. More targeted resources are needed to fully integrate research into clinical practice.",,,"Haller, K|Johantgen, M|Lundmark, V|Newhouse, RP|Shirey, M|Unruh, L|Weiss, M","Haller, Karen|Johantgen, Meg|Lundmark, Vicki|Newhouse, Robin P.|Shirey, Maria|Unruh, Lynn|Weiss, Marianne",198,-1,,,,,,,-1,,-1,,,,,,,,Article,10.1097/NNA.0000000000000465,,,,204,Clarivate Analytics Web of Science,,,,,,0002-0443,4,,,JOURNAL OF NURSING ADMINISTRATION,,,,NURSING-RESEARCH|QUALITY IMPROVEMENT|BARRIERS,-1,,,,APR,J,2017,,,,,,Nursing,,-1,,Nursing,,2,Building Research Infrastructure in Magnet (R) Hospitals: Current Status and Future Directions,2,,WOS:000398814500005,1,47,1539-0721,28333787,C:\Users\mginda\Desktop\agc1\wos-extract.isi,"Johantgen M, 2017, V47, P198, DOI 10.1097/NNA.0000000000000465"

"Indiana recently passed legislation allowing local governments to establish syringe exchanges. While the effectiveness of syringe exchange programming is established, there is a dearth of studies about associated policy adoption and implementation. This study documents the experiences of 24 Indiana counties engaged in the process of establishing syringe exchange programming under new state law. A mixed method, qualitative, exploratory case study was conducted from May 2015 to April 2016. We observed rapid and widespread policy adoption interest, and yet counties reported significant policy ambiguity, epidemiologic and resource capacity issues. The emergence of health commons involving information and tangible resource sharing networks allowed institutional rearrangement in the midst of resource scarcity; however, such rearrangement appeared to be a central threat to policy adoption and implementation given state structural barriers. The emerging commons could be a critical policy success factor, as it would achieve efficiencies not possible in the current resource environment, and can help achieve institutional rearrangement for the improvement of population health.

"Background: Advance care planning (ACP) is recommended for all persons to ensure that the care they receive aligns with their values and preferences. Objective: To evaluate an ACP intervention developed to better meet the needs and priorities of persons with chronic diseases, including mild cognitive impairment. Research Design: A year-long, pre-post intervention using lay community health workers [care coordinator assistants (CCAs)] trained to conduct and document ACP conversations with patients during home health visits with pre-post evaluation. Subjects: The 818 patients were 74.2 years old (mean); 78% women; 51% African American; 43% white. Measures: Documentation of ACP conversation in electronic health record fields and health care utilization outcomes. Results: In this target population ACP documentation rose from 3.4% (pre-CCA training) to 47.9% (post) of patients who had at least 1 discussion about ACP in the electronic health record. In the 1-year preintervention period, there were no differences in admissions, emergency department (ED) visits, and outpatient visits between patients who did and did not have ACP discussion. After adjusting for prior hospitalization and ED use histories, ACP discussions were associated with a 34% less probability of hospitalization (hazard ratios, 0.66; 95% confidence interval, 0.45-0.97), and similar effects are apparent on ED use independent of age and prior ED use effects. Conclusions: Patients with chronic diseases including mild cognitive impairment can engage in ACP conversations with trusted home health care providers. Having ACP conversation is associated with significant reduction in seeking urgent health care and in hospitalizations.",,,"Cottingham, AH|Griffin, WJ|Inui, TS|Ivy, SS|Litzelman, DK|Perkins, AJ|Schmitt-Wendholt, KM","Cottingham, Ann H.|Griffin, Wilma J.|Inui, Thomas S.|Ivy, Steven S.|Litzelman, Debra K.|Perkins, Anthony J.|Schmitt-Wendholt, Kathleen M.",319,-1,,,,,,,-1,,-1,,,,,,,,Article,10.1097/MLR.0000000000000675,,,,326,Clarivate Analytics Web of Science,,,,,,0025-7079,4,,,MEDICAL CARE,,,,RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED-TRIAL|CONGENITAL HEART-DISEASE|LATE-LIFE DEPRESSION|AGING BRAIN CENTER|CANCER-PATIENTS|LUNG-CANCER|END|MANAGEMENT|FAMILIES|PHYSICIANS,-1,,advanced care planning|community health workers|health care utilization,,APR,J,2017,,,,,,"Health Care Sciences & Services|Health Policy & Services|Public, Environmental & Occupational Health",,-1,,"Health Care Sciences & Services; Public, Environmental & Occupational Health",,6,Impact of Community Health Workers on Elderly Patients' Advance Care Planning and Health Care Utilization Moving the Dial,6,,WOS:000397598500003,1,55,1537-1948,27875482,C:\Users\mginda\Desktop\agc1\wos-extract.isi,"Litzelman DK, 2017, V55, P319, DOI 10.1097/MLR.0000000000000675"
"Objective: The authors sought to determine the risk of treatment-emergent mania associated with methylphenidate, used in monotherapy or with a concomitant mood-stabilizing medication, in patients with bipolar disorder. Method: Using linked Swedish national registries, the authors identified 2,307 adults with bipolar disorder who initiated therapy with methylphenidate between 2006 and 2014. The cohort was divided into two groups: those with and those without concomitant mood-stabilizing treatment. To adjust for individual-specific confounders, including disorder severity, genetic makeup, and early environmental factors, Cox regression analyses were used, conditioning on individual to compare the rate of mania (defined as hospitalization for mania or a new dispensation of stabilizing medication) 0-3 months and 3-6 months after medication start following nontreated periods. Results: Patients on methylphenidate monotherapy displayed an increased rate of manic episodes within 3 months of medication initiation (hazard ratio=6.7, 95% CI=2.0-22.4), with similar results for the subsequent 3 months. By contrast, for patients taking mood stabilizers, the risk of mania was lower after starting methylphenidate (hazard ratio=0.6, 95% CI=0.4-0.9). Comparable results were observed when only hospitalizations for mania were counted. Conclusions: No evidence was found for a positive association betweenmethylphenidate and treatment-emergent mania among patients with bipolar disorder who were concomitantly receiving a mood-stabilizing medication. This is clinically important given that up to 20% of people with bipolar disorder suffer from comorbid ADHD. Given the markedly increased hazard ratio of mania following methylphenidate initiation in bipolar patients not taking mood stabilizers, careful assessment to rule out bipolar disorder is indicated before initiating monotherapy with psychostimulants.",,"Magnusson, Patrik/C-4458-2017","Almqvist, C|Chang, Z|D'Onofrio, BM|Landen, M|Larsson, H|Lichtenstein, P|Lundholm, C|Magnusson, PKE|Ryden, E|Thase, ME|Viktorin, A","Almqvist, Catarina|Chang, Zheng|D'Onofrio, Brian M.|Landen, Mikael|Larsson, Henrik|Lichtenstein, Paul|Lundholm, Cecilia|Magnusson, Patrik K.

"Introduction: Alcohol expectancies are important determinants and predictors of adolescent alcohol use. Research with African Americans has shown that the endorsement of positive alcohol expectancies differs from that of Whites during childhood and predicts different alcohol outcomes during young adulthood. However, limited research has explored racial differences in the relationship between expectancy endorsement and alcohol use in school-aged adolescents. The current study examines the effect of White or African American race on the relationship between positive alcohol expectancies and alcohol use. Methods: Participants were 104 adolescents ages 12-18 who identified as either non-Hispanic White or non Hispanic African American. Participants completed self-report measures of alcohol consumption and positive social alcohol expectancies. Results: Preliminary analyses revealed no racial differences in alcohol expectancies or consumption. However, race moderated the relationship between alcohol expectancies and alcohol use such that more positive expectancies predicted alcohol use among White youth, but not African American youth. Conclusions: These results suggest that alcohol expectancies, which were thought to be important mediators of the relationship between social and personality factors and adolescent alcohol use may not be as impactful for African Americans. Future research should focus on identifying factors posing unique risk for alcohol consumption in this population. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

"This study was conducted to determine the feasibility of survey and interview research exploring views on sexual wellness among married individuals within the Latter Day Saint (LDS) faith community. Participants were asked questions about demographics, marital satisfaction, religious practice, sexual health and sexual satisfaction. Feasibility was measured by the expression of choice related to study participation: (1) electing to participate, (2) initiating participation, (3) selection of study engagement method, and (4) completion of each method. The sample included Utah residents married within the LDS faith, irrespective of whether currently practicing. Interested participants were given the option to volunteer through an anonymous online survey or interview. The majority (89.1) preferred to participate anonymously, and fully completed the online survey. Participants completed the full questionnaire despite being asked about ""taboo"" topics, such as with questions regarding sexual satisfaction. We concluded that it appears feasible to conduct sexual health research among individuals married within the LDS faith. This was the first empirical feasibility examination of sexual health studies among married Latter Day Saints. Future studies should continue to examine sexual health, while noting current church participation, and type of marriage, as this information seems to be essential when discussing sexual health with LDS married persons.",,,"Francis, H|Meyerson, BE","Francis, Heather|Meyerson, Beth E.",49,-1,,,,,,,-1,,-1,,,,,,,,Article,10.1007/s12119-016-9378-6,,,,61,Clarivate Analytics Web of Science,,,,,,1095-5143,1,,,SEXUALITY AND CULTURE,,,,MARITAL SATISFACTION|JESUS-CHRIST|RELIGION|BENEFITS|MORMONS|CHURCH|FAMILY|UTAH,-1,,Sexual health|LDS|Mormon|Feasibility|Marriage,,MAR,J,2017,,,,,,"Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",,-1,,Social Sciences - Other Topics,,0,"If You Build It, They Will Come: Feasibility of Sexual Health Research Among Individuals Married Within the Latter Day Saint Faith",0,,WOS:000411933600004,1,21,1936-4822,,C:\Users\mginda\Desktop\agc1\wos-extract.isi,"Francis H, 2017, V21, P49, DOI 10.1007/s12119-016-9378-6"
"This pilot study was designed to measure teamwork and the relationship of teamwork to patient perceptions of care among 63 members of 12 oncology teams at a Cancer Centre in the Midwest. Lack of teamwork in cancer care can result in serious clinical errors, fragmentation of care, and poor quality of care. Many oncology team members, highly skilled in clinical care, are not trained to work effectively as members of a care team. The research team administered the Relational Coordination survey to core oncology team membersmedical oncologists, nurse coordinators, and clinical secretariesto measure seven dimensions of team skills (four relating to communication [frequency, timeliness, accuracy, and problem solving] and three relating to relationship [shared goals, shared knowledge, and mutual respect]) averaged to create a Relational Coordination Index. The results indicated that among the team member roles, nurse coordinator relational coordination indices were the strongest and most positively correlated with patient perception of care. Statistically significant correlations were intra-nurse coordinator relational coordination indices and two patient perception of care factors (information and education and patient's preferences).

"We reviewed research regarding system-and visit-level strategies to enhance clinical preventive service delivery and quality for adolescents and young adults. Despite professional consensus on recommended services for adolescents, a strong evidence base for services for young adults, and improved financial access to services with the Affordable Care Act's provisions, receipt of preventive services remains suboptimal. Further research that builds off successful models of linking traditional and community clinics is needed to improve access to care for all youth. To optimize the clinical encounter, promising clinician-focused strategies to improve delivery of preventive services include screening and decision support tools, particularly when integrated into electronic medical record systems and supported by training and feedback. Although results have been mixed, interventions have moved beyond increasing service delivery to demonstrating behavior change. Research on emerging technologydsuch as gaming platforms, mobile phone applications, and wearable devicesdsuggests opportunities to expand clinicians' reach; however, existing research is based on limited clinical settings and populations. Improved monitoring systems and further research are needed to examine preventive services facilitators and ensure that interventions are effective across the range of clinical settings where youth receive preventive care, across multiple populations, including young adults, and for more vulnerable populations with less access to quality care.

"Purpose: Guidelines recommend surgical antibiotic prophylaxis for cleancontaminated procedures but none for clean procedures. The purpose of this study was to describe variations in surgical antibiotic prophylaxis for outpatient urological procedures at United States children's hospitals. Materials and Methods: Using the PHIS (Pediatric Health Information System (R)) database we performed a retrospective cohort study of patients younger than 18 years who underwent clean and/or clean-contaminated outpatient urological procedures from 2012 to 2014. We excluded those with concurrent nonurological procedures or an abscess/infected wound. We compared perioperative antibiotic charges for clean vs clean-contaminated procedures using a multilevel logistic regression model with a random effect for hospital. We also examined whether hospitals that were guideline compliant for clean procedures, defined as no surgical antibiotic prophylaxis, were also compliant for clean-contaminated procedures using the Pearson correlation coefficient. We examined hospital level variation in antibiotic rates using the coefficient of variation. Results: A total of 131,256 patients with a median age of 34 months at 39 hospitals met study inclusion criteria. Patients undergoing clean procedures were 14% less likely to receive guideline compliant surgical antibiotic prophylaxis than patients undergoing clean-contaminated procedures (OR 0.86, 95% CI 0.84e0.88, p < 0.0001). Hospitals that used antibiotics appropriately for clean-contaminated procedures were more likely to use antibiotics inappropriately for clean procedures (r = 0.7, p = 0.01). Greater variation was seen for hospital level compliance with surgical antibiotic prophylaxis for clean-contaminated procedures (range 9.8% to 97.8%, coefficient of variation 0.36) than for clean procedures (range 35.0% to 98.2%, coefficient of variation 0.20). Conclusions: Hospitals that used surgical antibiotic prophylaxis appropriately for clean-contaminated procedures were likely to use surgical antibiotic prophylaxis inappropriately for clean procedures. More variation was seen in hospital level guideline compliance for clean-contaminated procedures.",,,"Bell, TM|Benneyworth, BD|Cain, M|Carroll, AE|Chan, KH","Bell, Teresa M.|Benneyworth, Brian D.|Cain, Mark|Carroll, Aaron E.|Chan, Katherine H.",944,-1,,,,,,,-1,,-1,,,,,,,,Article,10.1016/j.juro.2016.08.115,,,,949,Clarivate Analytics Web of Science,,,,,,0022-5347,3,,,JOURNAL OF UROLOGY,,,,ANTIMICROBIAL PROPHYLAXIS|SURGERY|CARE|INFECTIONS|COLONIZATION|STRATEGIES|PREVENT|INFANTS|TRENDS,-1,,urology|practice patterns|physician's|antibiotic prophylaxis|pediatrics|outpatients,2,MAR,J,2017,,,,,,Urology & Nephrology,,-1,,Urology & Nephrology,,3,Variation in Surgical Antibiotic Prophylaxis for Outpatient Pediatric Urological Procedures at United States Children's Hospitals,3,,WOS:000396060000042,1,197,1527-3792,27821262,C:\Users\mginda\Desktop\agc1\wos-extract.isi,"Chan KH, 2017, V197, P944, DOI 10.1016/j.juro.2016.08.115"
"Elucidating how life history traits vary geographically is important to understanding variation in population dynamics. Because many aspects of ectotherm life history are climate-dependent, geographic variation in climate is expected to have a large impact on population dynamics through effects on annual survival, body size, growth rate, age at first reproduction, size-fecundity relationship, and reproductive frequency. The Eastern Massasauga (Sistrurus catenatus) is a small, imperiled North American rattlesnake with a distribution centered on the Great Lakes region, where lake effects strongly influence local conditions. To address Eastern Massasauga life history data gaps, we compiled data from 47 study sites representing 38 counties across the range. We used multimodel inference and general linear models with geographic coordinates and annual climate normals as explanatory variables to clarify patterns of variation in life history traits. We found strong evidence for geographic variation in six of nine life history variables. Adult female snout-vent length and neonate mass increased with increasing mean annual precipitation. Litter size decreased with increasing mean temperature, and the size-fecundity relationship and growth prior to first hibernation both increased with increasing latitude. The proportion of gravid females also increased with increasing latitude, but this relationship may be the result of geographically varying detection bias. Our results provide insights into ectotherm life history variation and fill critical data gaps, which will inform Eastern Massasauga conservation efforts by improving biological realism for models of population viability and climate change.",,,"Adamski, JM|Anton, TG|Bailey, RL|Baker, SJ|Bell, TA|Bieser, ND|Bissell, KM|Bradke, DR|Campa, H|Casper, GS|Cedar, K|Cross, MD|DeGregorio, BA|Dreslik, MJ|Faust, LJ|Harvey, DS|Hay, RW|Hileman, ET|Jellen, BC|Johnson, BD|Johnson, G|Kiel, BD|King, RB|Kingsbury, BA|Kowalski, MJ|Lee, YM|Lentini, AM|Marshall, JC|Mauger, D|Moore, JA|Paloski, RA|Phillips, CA|Pratt, PD|Preney, T|Prior, KA|Promaine, A|Redmer, M|Reinert, HK|Rouse, JD|Shoemaker, KT|Sutton, S|VanDeWalle, TJ|Weatherhead, PJ|Wynn, D|Yagi, A","Adamski, John M.|Anton, Thomas G.|Bailey, Robyn L.|Baker, Sarah J.|Bell, Thomas A., Jr.|Bieser, Nickolas D.|Bissell, Kristin M.|Bradke, Danielle R.|Campa, Henry, III|Casper, Gary S.|Cedar, Karen|Cross, Matthew D.|DeGregorio, Brett A.|Dreslik, Michael J.|Faust, Lisa J.|Harvey, Daniel S.|Hay, Robert W.|Hileman, Eric T.|Jellen, Benjamin C.|Johnson, Brent D.|Johnson, Glenn|Kiel, Brooke D.|King, Richard B.|Kingsbury, Bruce A.|Kowalski, Matthew J.|Lee, Yu Man|Lentini, Andrew M.|Marshall, John C.|Mauger, David|Moore, Jennifer A.|Paloski, Rori A.|Phillips, Christopher A.|Pratt, Paul D.|Preney, Thomas|Prior, Kent A.|Promaine, Andrew|Redmer, Michael|Reinert, Howard K.|Rouse, Jeremy D.|Shoemaker, Kevin T.|Sutton, Scott|VanDeWalle, Terry J.|Weatherhead, Patrick J.|Wynn, Doug|Yagi, Anne",,-1,,,,,,,-1,,-1,,,,,,,,Article,10.1371/journal.pone.0172011,,,,,Clarivate Analytics Web of Science,,,,,,1932-6203,2,,,PLOS ONE,,,e0172011,RATTLESNAKE CROTALUS-VIRIDIS|SNAKE THAMNOPHIS-ELEGANS|BODY-SIZE VARIATION|BERGMANNS RULE|HABITAT SELECTION|REPRODUCTIVE STRATEGIES|ENDANGERED RATTLESNAKE|NORTHERN POPULATION|THERMAL ECOLOGY|SPATIAL ECOLOGY,-1,,,,14-Feb,J,2017,,,,,,Multidisciplinary Sciences,,-1,,Science & Technology - Other Topics,,3,Climatic and geographic predictors of life history variation in Eastern Massasauga (Sistrurus catenatus): A range-wide synthesis,3,,WOS:000394423900043,1,12,,28196149,C:\Users\mginda\Desktop\agc1\wos-extract.isi,"Hileman ET, 2017, V12, DOI 10.1371/journal.pone.0172011"

"Background: Changing training paradigms in vascular surgery have been introduced to reduce overall training time. Herein, we sought to examine how shortened training for vascular surgeons may have influenced overall divisional academic productivity. Methods: Faculty from the top 55 surgery departments were identified according to National Institutes of Health (NIH) funding. Academic metrics of 315 vascular surgery, 1,132 general surgery, and 2,403 other surgical specialties faculty were examined using institutional Web sites, Scopus, and NIH Research Portfolio Online Reporting Tools from September 1, 2014, to January 31, 2015. Individual-level and aggregate numbers of publications, citations, and NIH funding were determined. Results: The mean size of the vascular divisions was 5 faculty. There was no correlation between department size and academic productivity of individual faculty members (R-2 = 0.68, P = 0.2). Overall percentage of vascular surgery faculty with current or former NIH funding was 20%, of which 10.8% had major NIH grants (R01/U01/P01). Vascular surgery faculty associated with integrated vascular training programs demonstrated significantly greater academic productivity. Publications and citations were higher for vascular surgery faculty from institutions with both integrated and traditional training programs (48 of 1,051) compared to those from programs with integrated training alone (37 of 485) or traditional fellowships alone (26 of 439; P < 0.05). Conclusions: In this retrospective examination, academic productivity was improved within vascular surgery divisions with integrated training programs or both program types. These data suggest that the earlier specialization of integrated residencies in addition to increasing dedicated vascular training time may actually help promote research within the field of vascular surgery.",,,"Bell, TM|Davies, MG|Kim, BJ|Koniaris, LG|Liang, TW|Murphy, MP|Valsangkar, NP|Zimmers, TA","Bell, Teresa M.|Davies, Mark G.|Kim, Bradford J.|Koniaris, Leonidas G.|Liang, Tiffany W.|Murphy, Michael P.|Valsangkar, Nakul P.|Zimmers, Teresa A.",242,-1,,,,,,,-1,,-1,,,,,,,,Article,10.1016/j.avsg.2016.06.031,,,,249,Clarivate Analytics Web of Science,,,,,,0890-5096,,,,ANNALS OF VASCULAR SURGERY,,,,TRAINING-PROGRAMS|APPLICANT POOL|UNITED-STATES|DEPARTMENTS,-1,"Liang, Tiffany/0000-0002-3282-1757",,,FEB,J,2017,,,,,,Surgery|Peripheral Vascular Disease,,-1,,Surgery; Cardiovascular System & Cardiology,,0,Impact of Integrated Vascular Residencies on Academic Productivity within Vascular Surgery Divisions,0,,WOS:000397010900027,1,39,1615-5947,27671458,C:\Users\mginda\Desktop\agc1\wos-extract.isi,"Kim BJ, 2017, V39, P242, DOI 10.1016/j.avsg.2016.06.031"
"Psychometric testing of the Shared Vision (SV) scale that measures team efforts toward common patient-centered goals was initially estimated among rural hospital nurse executives. The purpose of this study was to estimate the scale's reliability (internal consistency), convergent validity (Pearson correlation with Practice Environment Scale), and structural validity (ordinal confirmatory factor analysis) among acute care Magnet((R)) hospital nurses. The study sample included 289 nurses from 27 acute care Magnet (R) hospitals. The scale demonstrated acceptable estimates for internal consistency (Cronbach's = .902, 95% confidence interval [CI] = [0.883, 0.919]), convergent validity (r = .720, p < .001), and structural validity with a one-factor structure. The findings of this study supported the reliability and validity of the SV scale as a unidimensional construct in measuring SV among nurses in acute care Magnet (R) hospitals.

"Background. Advanced paternal age at childbirth is associated with psychiatric disorders in offspring, including schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and autism. However, few studies have investigated paternal age's relationship with eating disorders in offspring. In a large, population-based cohort, we examined the association between paternal age and offspring eating disorders, and whether that association remains after adjustment for potential confounders (e.g. parental education level) that may be related to late/early selection into fatherhood and to eating disorder incidence. Method. Data for 2 276 809 individuals born in Sweden 1979-2001 were extracted from Swedish population and health-care registers. The authors used Cox proportional hazards models to examine the effect of paternal age on the first incidence of healthcare-recorded anorexia nervosa (AN) and all eating disorders (AED) occurring 1987-2009. Models were adjusted for sex, birth order, maternal age at childbirth, and maternal and paternal covariates including country of birth, highest education level, and lifetime psychiatric and criminal history. Results. Even after adjustment for covariates including maternal age, advanced paternal age was associated with increased risk, and younger paternal age with decreased risk, of AN and AED. For example, the fully adjusted hazard ratio for the 45+ years (v. the 25-29 years) paternal age category was 1.32 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.14-1.53] for AN and 1.26 (95% CI 1.13-1.40) for AED. Conclusions. In this large, population-based cohort, paternal age at childbirth was positively associated with eating disorders in offspring, even after adjustment for potential confounders. Future research should further explore potential explanations for the association, including de novo mutations in the paternal germline.",,"Norring, Claes/F-9173-2013","Almqvist, C|Baker, JH|Birgegard, A|Bulik, CM|D'Onofrio, BM|Javaras, KN|Landen, M|Larsson, H|Lichtenstein, P|Norring, C|Peat, CM|Rickert, ME|Thornton, LM","Almqvist, Catarina|Baker, J.

"Purpose: More physicians need to acquire the skills of primary palliative care. Medical students' clerkship experiences with death, dying, and palliative care (DDPC), however, may create barriers to learning such skills during residency. Whether professional development is differentially affected by DDPC is unknown. This knowledge gap potentially hinders the development of educational strategies to optimize students' preparedness for primary palliative care. Method: Third-year students submitted professionalism narratives (N = 4062) during their internal medicine clerkship between 2004 and 2011. We identified DDPC-related narratives and then randomly selected control narratives. Narratives were compared by valence (positive or negative) and professionalism-related themes. Results and Conclusion: Less than 10% of the narratives were related to DDPC, but the majority was positive. There was a significant overlap in professionalism themes between DDPC and control narratives. The results suggest student preparedness for primary palliative care may be improved by addressing the common professionalism challenges of clinical clerkships.",,,"Banno, D|Burns, D|Cottingham, AH|Cripe, LD|Frankel, RM|Hedrick, DG|Hoffmann, ML|Litzelman, DK|Martenyi, N|Rand, KL","Banno, Daniella|Burns, Debra|Cottingham, Ann H.|Cripe, Larry D.|Frankel, Richard M.|Hedrick, David G.|Hoffmann, Mary L.|Litzelman, Debra K.|Martenyi, Nora|Rand, Kevin L.",79,-1,,,,,,,-1,,-1,,,,,,,,Article,10.1177/1049909115609296,,,,84,Clarivate Analytics Web of Science,,,,,,1049-9091,1,,,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF HOSPICE & PALLIATIVE MEDICINE,,,,END-OF-LIFE|HIDDEN CURRICULUM|EDUCATION|SCHOOL|RESIDENTS|ATTITUDES|TRAINEES|HOSPICE|IMPACT,-1,,death|dying|palliative care|professionalism|undergraduate medical education|end-of-life care,,FEB,J,2017,,,,,,Health Care Sciences & Services,,-1,,Health Care Sciences & Services,,1,"Medical Students' Professionalism Narratives Reveal That Experiences With Death, Dying, or Palliative Care Are More Positive Than Other Experiences During Their Internal Medicine Clerkship",1,,WOS:000392873300010,1,34,1938-2715,26430135,C:\Users\mginda\Desktop\agc1\wos-extract.isi,"Cripe LD, 2017, V34, P79, DOI 10.1177/1049909115609296"
"AimThe convergence of three major trends in medicine, namely conversion to electronic health records (EHRs), prioritization of translational research, and the need to control healthcare expenditures, has created unprecedented interest and opportunities to develop systems that improve care while reducing costs. However, operationalizing a learning health system' requires systematic changes that have not yet been widely demonstrated in clinical practice. MethodWe developed, implemented, and evaluated a model of EHR-supported care in a cohort of 131 children with cerebral palsy that integrated clinical care, quality improvement, and research, entitled Learn From Every Patient' (LFEP). ResultsChildren treated in the LFEP Program for a 12-month period experienced a 43% reduction in total inpatient days (p=0.030 vs prior 12mo period), a 27% reduction in inpatient admissions, a 30% reduction in emergency department visits (p=0.001), and a 29% reduction in urgent care visits (p=0.046). LFEP Program implementation also resulted in reductions in healthcare costs of 210% (US$7014/child) versus a Time control group, and reductions of 176% ($6596/child) versus a Program Activities control group. Importantly, clinical implementation of the LFEP Program has also driven the continuous accumulation of robust research-quality data for both publication and implementation of evidence-based improvements in clinical care. InterpretationThese results demonstrate that a learning health system can be developed and implemented in a cost-effective manner, and can integrate clinical care and research to systematically drive simultaneous clinical quality improvement and reduced healthcare costs.",,,"Embi, PJ|Lowes, LP|Newmeyer, A|Noritz, GH|Smoyer, WE|Yin, H","Embi, Peter J.|Lowes, Linda P.|Newmeyer, Amy|Noritz, Garey H.|Smoyer, William E.|Yin, Han",183,-1,,,,,,,-1,,-1,,,,,,,,Article,10.1111/dmcn.13227,,,,191,Clarivate Analytics Web of Science,,,Learn Every Patient' Study Grp,,,0012-1622,2,,,DEVELOPMENTAL MEDICINE AND CHILD NEUROLOGY,,,,CARE-SYSTEM|ETHICAL OVERSIGHT|CEREBRAL-PALSY|COMMON RULE|CHILDREN|CENTERS,-1,"Noritz, Garey/0000-0001-7308-3810; Lowes, Linda/0000-0003-4206-0557",,,FEB,J,2017,,,,,,Clinical Neurology|Pediatrics,,-1,,Neurosciences & Neurology; Pediatrics,,9,"""Learn From Every Patient': implementation and early results of a learning health system",9,,WOS:000392830000020,1,59,1469-8749,27545839,C:\Users\mginda\Desktop\agc1\wos-extract.isi,"Lowes LP, 2017, V59, P183, DOI 10.1111/dmcn.13227"
"Background: About 25% of the worldwide population suffers from mental, neurological and substance use disorders but unfortunately, up to 75% of affected persons do not have access to the treatment they need. Data on the magnitude of the mental health problem in Kenya is scarce. The objectives of this study were to establish the prevalence and the socio-demographic factors associated with mental and substance use disorders in Kosirai division, Nandi County, Western Kenya. Methods: This was a cross sectional descriptive study in which participants were selected by simple random sampling. The sampling frame was obtained from a data base of the population in the study area developed during door-to-door testing and counseling exercises for HIV/AIDS. Four hundred and twenty consenting adults were interviewed by psychologists using the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview Version 7 for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual 5th Edition and a researcher-designed social demographic questionnaire. Results: One hundred and ninety one (45%) of the participants had a lifetime diagnosis of at least one of the mental disorders. Of these, 66 (15.7%) had anxiety disorder, 53 (12.3%) had major depressive disorder; 49 (11.7%) had alcohol and substance use disorder. 32 (7.6%) had experienced a psychotic episode and 69 (16.4%) had a life-time suicidal attempt. Only 7 (1.7%) had ever been diagnosed with a mental illness. Having a mental condition was associated with age less than 60 years and having a medical condition. Conclusion: A large proportion of the community has had a mental disorder in their lifetime and most of these conditions are undiagnosed and therefore not treated. These findings indicate a need for strategies that will promote diagnosis and treatment of community members with psychiatric disorders. In order to screen more people for mental illness, we recommend further research to evaluate a strategy similar to the home based counseling and testing for HIV and the use of simple screening tools.",,,"Atwoli, L|Epstein, S|Kwobah, E|Litzelman, DK|Mwangi, A","Atwoli, Lukoye|Epstein, Steve|Kwobah, Edith|Litzelman, Debra K.|Mwangi, Ann",,-1,,,,,,,-1,,-1,,,,,,,,Article,10.1186/s12888-017-1202-9,,,,,Clarivate Analytics Web of Science,,,,,,1471-244X,,,,BMC PSYCHIATRY,,,30,COMMON MENTAL-DISORDERS|HEALTH|POPULATION|EDUCATION|12-MONTH|LIFETIME|ILLNESS|GENDER,-1,,Mental disorders|Prevalence|Mini International Neuropsychiatry Interview|Western Kenya,,18-Jan,J,2017,,,,,,Psychiatry,,-1,,Psychiatry,,3,Prevalence of psychiatric morbidity in a community sample in Western Kenya,3,,WOS:000394384400004,1,17,,28100210,C:\Users\mginda\Desktop\agc1\wos-extract.isi,"Kwobah E, 2017, V17, DOI 10.1186/s12888-017-1202-9"

Most current CRIOs are the first officers in their institutions to hold that role. To date there is very little published information about this role and the individuals who serve it. Objective: To increase our understanding of the CRIO role, the leaders who serve it, and the factors associated with their success in their organizations. Methods: The Clinical Research Informatics Working Group of the American Medical Informatics Association (AMIA) conducted a national survey of CRIOs in the United States and convened an expert panel of CRIOs to discuss their experience during the 2016 AMIA Annual Symposium. Results: CRIOs come from diverse academic backgrounds. Most have advance training and extensive experience in biomedical informatics but the majority have been CRIOs for less than three years. CRIOs identify funding, data governance, and advancing data analytics as their major challenges. Conclusion: CRIOs play an important role in helping shape the future of clinical research, innovation, and data analytics in healthcare in their organizations. They share many of the same challenges and see the same opportunities for the future of the field. Better understanding the background and experience of current CRIOs can help define and develop the role in other organizations and enhance their influence in the field of research informatics.",,,"Barnett, WK|Embi, PJ|Fultz-Hollis, K|Mosa, ASM|Sanchez-Pinto, LN|Tachinardi, U","Barnett, William K.|Embi, Peter J.|Fultz-Hollis, Kate|Mosa, Abu S.

"Background: Dispositional impulsivity has been consistently implicated as a risk factor for problem drinking among college students and research suggests that this relationship may be explained in part by alcohol expectancies. A subset of alcohol expectancies, sex-related alcohol expectancies, is particularly linked to problem drinking among college students. The acquired preparedness model of risk postulates that people with dispositional impulsivity develop stronger sex-related alcohol expectancies, are subsequently more likely to drink at problematic levels in sexual situations, and thus, engage in more problem drinking. Objectives: Using this model, the current study examined whether sex-related alcohol expectancies and alcohol use at sex mediated the relationship between impulsivity and problem drinking among college students. Methods: College students (N = 101) completed self-report measures of alcohol use, sex-related alcohol expectancies, and five dimensions of impulsivity: negative urgency, positive urgency, sensation seeking, lack of premeditation, and lack of perseverance. Results: Two facets of impulsivitysensation seeking and lack of premeditationprovided unique contributions to problem drinking. Sex-related alcohol expectancies significantly mediated the effects of lack of premeditation and sensation seeking on problem drinking. In support of the acquired preparedness model, the relationship between the impulsivity traits and problem drinking was serially mediated by sex-related alcohol expectancies and alcohol use at sex. Conclusions: Results suggest that sensation seeking and lack of premeditation continue to be areas of intervention for problem drinking among college students, and implicate sex-related alcohol expectancies as an area of intervention for alcohol use at sex and problem drinking.",,,"Banks, DE|Zapolski, TCB","Banks, Devin E.|Zapolski, Tamika C.

"Most prior studies use objectively measured data (e.g., census-based indicators) to assess contextual risks. However, teens' observations might be more important for their risk behavior. Objectives: 1) determine relationships between observed and objective indicators of contextual risks 2) determine relations of observed and objective indicators with teen alcohol use and problem behavior. Teens aged 14-16 (N=170) carried GPS-enabled smartphones for one month, with locations documented. Ecological momentary assessment (EMA) measured teens' observations via texts regarding risk behaviors and environmental observations. Objective indicators of alcohol outlets and disorganization were spatially joined to EMAs based on teens' location at the time of the texts. Observed and objective disorganization, and objective indicators of alcohol outlets were related to alcohol use. Observed disorganization was related to problem behavior, while objective indicators were unrelated. Findings suggest the importance of considering teens' observations of contextual risk for understanding influences on risk behavior and suggest future directions for research and prevention strategies.",,"Wiehe, Sarah/R-6083-2017; Wiebe, Douglas/Q-1168-2017","Byrnes, HF|Miller, BA|Morrison, CN|Wiebe, DJ|Wiehe, SE|Woychik, M","Byrnes, Hilary F.|Miller, Brenda A.|Morrison, Christopher N.|Wiebe, Douglas J.|Wiehe, Sarah E.|Woychik, Marcie",151,-1,,,,,,,-1,,-1,,,,,,,,Article,10.1016/j.healthplace.2016.12.004,,,,157,Clarivate Analytics Web of Science,,,,,,1353-8292,,,,HEALTH & PLACE,,,,NEIGHBORHOOD DISORDER|SUBSTANCE USE|PERCEIVED NEIGHBORHOOD|SOCIAL-DISORGANIZATION|PROTECTIVE FACTORS|OUTLET DENSITY|MENTAL-HEALTH|DRINKING|CONTEXT|ADOLESCENTS,-1,"Wiehe, Sarah/0000-0002-8148-0848;",Neighborhood context|Observations|GPS|Alcohol outlets|Adolescent alcohol use,,JAN,J,2017,,,,,,"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health",,-1,,"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health",,1,Association of environmental indicators with teen alcohol use and problem behavior: Teens' observations vs. objectively-measured indicators,1,,WOS:000394402400019,1,43,1873-2054,28061392,C:\Users\mginda\Desktop\agc1\wos-extract.isi,"Byrnes HF, 2017, V43, P151, DOI 10.1016/j.healthplace.2016.12.004"
"There is a need to develop methods to analyze Big Data to inform patient-centered interventions for better health outcomes. The purpose of this study was to develop and test a method to explore Big Data to describe salient health concerns of people with epilepsy. Specifically, we used Word Adjacency Graph modeling to explore a data set containing 1.9 billion anonymous text queries submitted to the ChaCha question and answer service to (a) detect clusters of epilepsy-related topics, and (b) visualize the range of epilepsy-related topics and their mutual proximity to uncover the breadth and depth of particular topics and groups of users. Applied to a large, complex data set, this method successfully identified clusters of epilepsy-related topics while allowing for separation of potentially non-relevant topics. The method can be used to identify patient-driven research questions from large social media data sets and results can inform the development of patient-centered interventions.",,,"Groves, D|Knopf, A|Miller, WR|Otte, JL|Silverman, RD","Groves, Doyle|Knopf, Amelia|Miller, Wendy R.|Otte, Julie L.|Silverman, Ross D.",166,-1,,,,,,,-1,,-1,,,,,,,,Article,10.1177/0193945916670363,,,,185,Clarivate Analytics Web of Science,,,,,,0193-9459,1,,,WESTERN JOURNAL OF NURSING RESEARCH,,,,HYBRID CONCEPT ANALYSIS|SELF-MANAGEMENT|EPILEPSY|HEALTH|ADULTS,-1,,epilepsy|Big Data|methods|informatics|machine learning,,JAN,J,2017,,,,,,Nursing,,-1,SI,Nursing,,3,Word Adjacency Graph Modeling: Separating Signal From Noise in Big Data,3,,WOS:000393663300011,1,39,1552-8456,27655959,C:\Users\mginda\Desktop\agc1\wos-extract.isi,"Miller WR, 2017, V39, P166, DOI 10.1177/0193945916670363"
"There is growing evidence that opioid prescribing in the United States follows a pattern in which patients who are at the highest risk of adverse outcomes from opioids are more likely to receive long-term opioid therapy. These patients include, in particular, those with substance use disorders (SUDs) and other psychiatric conditions. This study examined health insurance claims among 10,311,961 patients who filled prescriptions for opioids. Specifically, we evaluated how opioid receipt differed among patients with and without a wide range of preexisting psychiatric and behavioral conditions (ie, opioid and nonopioid SUDs, suicide attempts or other self-injury, motor vehicle crashes, and depressive, anxiety, and sleep disorders) and psychoactive medications (ie, antidepressants, benzodiazepines, hypnotics, mood stabilizers, antipsychotics, and medications used for SUD, tobacco cessation, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder). Relative to those without, patients with all assessed psychiatric conditions and medications had modestly greater odds of subsequently filling prescriptions for opioids and, in particular, substantially greater risk of long-term opioid receipt. Increases in risk for long-term opioid receipt in adjusted Cox regressions ranged from approximately 1.5-fold for prior attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder medication prescriptions (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.53; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.48-1.58) to approximately 3-fold for prior nonopioid SUD diagnoses (HR = 3.15; 95% CI, 3.06-3.24) and nearly 9-fold for prior opioid use disorder diagnoses (HR = 8.70; 95% CI, 8.20-9.24). In sum, we found evidence of greater opioid receipt among commercially insured patients with a breadth of psychiatric conditions. Future studies assessing behavioral outcomes associated with opioid prescribing should consider preexisting psychiatric conditions.",,,"Bair, MJ|Chang, Z|D'Onofrio, BM|Gibbons, RD|Hur, K|Krebs, EE|Kroenke, K|Quinn, PD|Rickert, ME|Scott, EL","Bair, Matthew J.|Chang, Zheng|D'Onofrio, Brian M.|Gibbons, Robert D.|Hur, Kwan|Krebs, Erin E.|Kroenke, Kurt|Quinn, Patrick D.|Rickert, Martin|Scott, Eric L.",140,-1,,,,,,,-1,,-1,,,,,,,,Article,10.1097/j.pain.0000000000000730,,,,148,Clarivate Analytics Web of Science,,,,,,0304-3959,1,,,PAIN,,,,CHRONIC NONCANCER PAIN|LOW-BACK-PAIN|NORWEGIAN PRESCRIPTION DATABASE|MENTAL-HEALTH|SEDATIVE-HYPNOTICS|MISSING P|DISORDERS|RISK|DEPRESSION|OVERDOSE,-1,"Quinn, Patrick/0000-0002-6770-8762",Adverse selection|Epidemiology|Health insurance claims|Prescription opioid analgesics,,JAN,J,2017,,,,,,Anesthesiology|Clinical Neurology|Neurosciences,,-1,,Anesthesiology; Neurosciences & Neurology,,15,Incident and long-term opioid therapy among patients with psychiatric conditions and medications: a national study of commercial health care claims,15,,WOS:000392233400018,1,158,1872-6623,27984526,C:\Users\mginda\Desktop\agc1\wos-extract.isi,"Quinn PD, 2017, V158, P140, DOI 10.1097/j.pain.0000000000000730"
"Objective: To determine the academic contribution as measured by number of publications, citations, and NIH funding from PhD scientists in US departments of surgery. Summary Background Data: The number of PhD faculty working in US medical school clinical departments now exceeds the number working in basic science departments. The academic impact of PhDs in surgery has not been previously evaluated. Methods: Academic metrics for 3850 faculties at the top 55 NIH-funded university and hospital-based departments of surgery were collected using NIH RePORTER, Scopus, and departmental websites. Results: MD/PhDs and PhDs had significantly higher numbers of publications and citations than MDs, regardless of academic or institutional rank. PhDs had the greatest proportion of NIH funding compared to both MDs and MD/PhDs. Across all academic ranks, 50.2% of PhDs had received NIH funding compared with 15.2% of MDs and 33.9% of MD/PhDs (P < 0.001). The proportion of PhDs with NIH funding in the top 10 departments did not differ from those working in departments ranked 11 to 50 (P = 0.456). A greater percentage of departmental PhD faculty was associated with increased rates of MD funding. Conclusions: The presence of dedicated research faculty with PhDs supports the academic mission of surgery departments by increasing both NIH funding and scholarly productivity. In contrast to MDs and MD/PhDs, PhDs seem to have similar levels of academic output and funding independent of the overall NIH funding environment of their department. This suggests that research programs in departments with limited resources may be enhanced by the recruitment of PhD faculty.",,,"Bell, TM|Blanton, C|Joshi, MM|Koniaris, LG|Mayo, JS|Torbeck, L|Valsangkar, NP|Zimmers, TA","Bell, Teresa M.|Blanton, Casi|Joshi, Mugdha M.|Koniaris, Leonidas G.|Mayo, John S.|Torbeck, Laura|Valsangkar, Nakul P.|Zimmers, Teresa A.",111,-1,,,,,,,-1,,-1,,,,,,,,Article,10.1097/SLA.0000000000001657,,,,115,Clarivate Analytics Web of Science,,,,,,0003-4932,1,,,ANNALS OF SURGERY,,,,SCIENCE,-1,,academic productivity|funding|publication|research,,JAN,J,2017,,,,,,Surgery,,-1,,Surgery,,2,The Role of PhD Faculty in Advancing Research in Departments of Surgery,2,,WOS:000392106500024,1,265,1528-1140,28009734,C:\Users\mginda\Desktop\agc1\wos-extract.isi,"Bell TM, 2017, V265, P111, DOI 10.1097/SLA.0000000000001657"

"BACKGROUND: Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is associated with high rates of psychiatric comorbidity, including depression. However, it is unclear whether ADHD medication increases or decreases the risk for depression. METHODS: We studied all individuals with a diagnosis of ADHD born between 1960 and 1998 in Sweden (N = 38,752). We obtained data for prescription of ADHD medication, diagnosis of depression and other psychiatric disorders, and sociodemographic factors from population-based registers. The association between ADHD medication and depression was estimated with Cox proportional hazards regression. RESULTS: After adjustment for sociodemographic and clinical confounders, ADHD medication was associated with a reduced long-term risk (i.e., 3 years later) for depression (hazard ratio = 0.58;95% confidence interval, 0.51-0.67). The risk was lower for longer duration of ADHD medication. Also, ADHD medication was associated with reduced rates of concurrent depression; within-individual analysis suggested that occurrence of depression was 20% less common during periods when patients received ADHD medication compared with periods when they did not (hazard ratio = 0.80; 95% confidence interval, 0.70-0.92). CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that ADHD medication does not increase the risk of later depression; rather, medication was associated with a reduced risk for subsequent and concurrent depression.",,,"Chang, Z|D'Onofrio, BM|Larsson, H|Lichtenstein, P|Quinn, PD","Chang, Zheng|D'Onofrio, Brian M.|Larsson, Henrik|Lichtenstein, Paul|Quinn, Patrick D.",916,-1,,,,,,,-1,,-1,,,,,,,,Article,10.1016/j.biopsych.2016.02.018,,,,922,Clarivate Analytics Web of Science,,,,,,0006-3223,12,,,BIOLOGICAL PSYCHIATRY,,,,DEFICIT-HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER|METHYLPHENIDATE TREATMENT|ADHD MEDICATIONS|FOLLOW-UP|CHILDREN|STIMULANTS|COMORBIDITY|REGISTER|DATABASE|SAFETY,-1,"Quinn, Patrick/0000-0002-6770-8762",ADHD medication|Cohort study|Depression|Long-term effect|Short-term effect|Stimulants,,15-Dec,J,2016,,,,,,Neurosciences|Psychiatry,,-1,,Neurosciences & Neurology; Psychiatry,,10,Medication for Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder and Risk for Depression: A Nationwide Longitudinal Cohort Study,10,,WOS:000392754000007,1,80,1873-2402,27086545,C:\Users\mginda\Desktop\agc1\wos-extract.isi,"Chang Z, 2016, V80, P916, DOI 10.1016/j.biopsych.2016.02.018"
"Objective: Although patients want to participate in discussions and decisions about their end-of-life care, studies show that providers frequently fail to invite them to explore advanced care preferences or goals for living. The purpose of our demonstration project was to provide education and coaching to individuals, health providers, and organizations across the state of Indiana intended to facilitate these conversations, documenting and honoring individuals' life goals and preferences for care during the final stages of life. Method: Education and training engaged community members as well as healthcare providers to: (1) improve participant comfort and facility discussing end-of-life issues; (2) improve knowledge of healthcare choices, including palliative and hospice care; and (3) prepare all participants to explore and document personal values, life goals, and priorities as well as goals of care. Results: Between January of 2013 and June of 2015, the team educated close to 5,000 participants. Participants' ratings of the quality and perceived usefulness of the educational events ranged from 4 to 5 (using a 5-point scale, with 5 = most effective). Participant comments were overwhelmingly favorable and indicated an intention to put the advance care planning resources, communication skills, knowledge of palliative and hospice care, and personal renewal techniques into practice. Significance of Results: Participant motivation to foster advance care planning, discussions of palliative care, and end-of-life conversations was facilitated by the reframing of these conversations as identifying goals of care and priorities for living well during an important stage of life. Successful strategies included helping providers and patients to adopt a broader meaning for ""sustaining hope"" (not for cure, but for engaging in highly valued activities), developing provider communication skills and comfort in initiating potentially difficult discussions, engaging a new community health workforce who will develop trusting relationships with patients in home-based services, and fostering self-awareness and self-care among palliative care providers.",,,"Cottingham, AH|Griffin, WJ|Inui, TS|Ivy, SS|Litzelman, DK","Cottingham, Ann H.|Griffin, Wilma J.|Inui, Thomas S.|Ivy, Steven S.|Litzelman, Debra K.",641,-1,,,,,,,-1,,-1,,,,,,,,Article,10.1017/S1478951516000353,,,,651,Clarivate Analytics Web of Science,,,,,,1478-9515,6,,,PALLIATIVE & SUPPORTIVE CARE,,,,RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED-TRIAL|CONGENITAL HEART-DISEASE|COLLABORATIVE CARE|ELDERLY-PATIENTS|DECISION-MAKING|CANCER-PATIENTS|DEMENTIA CARE|OLDER-ADULTS|LUNG-CANCER|DEPRESSION,-1,,Skill development|End-of-life conversations|Provider self-awareness and selfcare|Community health workers|End-of-life conversations,,DEC,J,2016,,,,,,Health Policy & Services,,-1,,Health Care Sciences & Services,,1,Enhancing the prospects for palliative care at the end of life: A statewide educational demonstration project to improve advance care planning,1,,WOS:000393181400007,1,14,1478-9523,27320687,C:\Users\mginda\Desktop\agc1\wos-extract.isi,"Litzelman DK, 2016, V14, P641, DOI 10.1017/S1478951516000353"
"IMPORTANCE Differences in cardiovascular autonomic activity between individuals with psychiatric disorders and healthy controls have been observed, but whether cardiovascular autonomic abnormalities are associated with subsequent psychiatric disorders is unknown. OBJECTIVE To investigate whether differences in cardiac autonomic function as indexed by resting heart rate and blood pressure are associated with psychiatric disorders during the lifetime of men in Sweden. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS We conducted a longitudinal register-based study of Swedish men whose resting heart rate (n = 1 039 443) and blood pressure (n = 1 555 979) were measured at military conscription at a mean (SD) age of 18.3 (0.6) years during the period from 1969 to 2010, with register-based follow-up data available until the end of 2013. Analyses were performed from November 18, 2015, to June 9, 2016. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Dates of inpatient/outpatient diagnoses of anxiety disorders, obsessive-compulsive disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, depressive disorders, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and substance use disorders and convictions for violent crimes, between 1973 and 2013, were obtained from nationwide registers. Adjustments were made for height, weight, body mass index, cardiorespiratory fitness, cognitive ability, and socioeconomic covariates. RESULTS After adjustment for covariates, Cox regression models with up to 45 years of follow-up data showed that men (mean [SD] age of 18.3 [0.6] years at conscription) with resting heart rates above 82 beats per minute had a 69% (95% CI, 46%-94%) increased risk for obsessive-compulsive disorder, a 21% (95% CI, 11%-33%) increased risk for schizophrenia, and an 18%(95% CI, 13%-22%) increased risk for anxiety disorders compared with men with resting heart rates below 62 beats per minute. Similar associations were observed with systolic/diastolic blood pressure. In contrast, lower resting heart rate and lower systolic blood pressure were associated with substance use disorders and violent criminality. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Our results suggest that for men, differences in heart rate and blood pressure in late adolescence are associated with lifetime major psychiatric disorders, with higher levels associated with obsessive-compulsive disorder, schizophrenia, and anxiety disorders and lower levels associated with substance use disorders and violent behavior.

"Objective: The purpose of this study was to describe variations in blood-based resuscitation in an injured cohort. We hypothesize that distinct transfusion trajectories are present. Background: Retrospective studies of hemorrhage utilize the concept of massive transfusion, where a set volume of blood is required. Patterns of hemorrhage vary and massive transfusion does little to describe these differences. Methods: Patients were prospectively included from June 2012 to 2013. Time of transfusion for each packed red blood cell (PRBC) transfused was recorded, in minutes, for all patients. Additional measures included demographic and injury data, admission laboratory values, and vital signs and outcomes including mortality, tempo of transfusion, and operative requirements. Group-based trajectory modeling was utilized to describe transfusion trajectories throughout the cohort. Results: Three hundred sixteen patients met the inclusion criteria. Among them, 72% were men and median age was 35 years (interquartile range [IQR] 24-50), median injury severity score was 13 (IQR 9-22), median 24-hour transfusion volume was 4 units of PRBCs (IQR 2-8), and mortality was 14%. Six transfusion trajectories were identified. Among the patients, 35% received negligible transfusions (group 1). Groups 2 and 3 received greater than 15 units PRBCs-the former as early resuscitation, whereas the latter intermittently throughout the day. Groups 4 and 5 had similar small resuscitations with distinct demographic differences. Group 6 suffered blunt injuries and required rapid resuscitation. Conclusions: Traditional definitions of massive transfusion are broad and imprecise. In cohorts of severely injured patients, there are distinct, identifiable transfusion trajectories. Identification of subgroups is important in understanding clinical course and to anticipate resuscitative and therapeutic needs.",,,"Bell, TM|Savage, SA|Sumislawski, JJ|Zarzaur, BL","Bell, Teresa M.|Savage, Stephanie A.|Sumislawski, Joshua J.|Zarzaur, Ben L., Jr.",1135,-1,,,,,,,-1,,-1,,,,,,,,Article,10.1097/SLA.0000000000001555,,,,1141,Clarivate Analytics Web of Science,,,,,,0003-4932,6,,,ANNALS OF SURGERY,,,,FRESH-FROZEN PLASMA|MASSIVE TRANSFUSION|IMPROVED SURVIVAL|MORTALITY|RATIOS|RISK|BIAS,-1,,critical administration threshold|hemorrhage|injuries|massive transfusion|transfusion trajectories,,DEC,J,2016,,,,,,Surgery,,-1,,Surgery,,4,Utilizing Group-based Trajectory Modeling to Understand Patterns of Hemorrhage and Resuscitation,4,,WOS:000387978500044,1,264,1528-1140,26727091,C:\Users\mginda\Desktop\agc1\wos-extract.isi,"Savage SA, 2016, V264, P1135, DOI 10.1097/SLA.0000000000001555"
"Substance use is a pervasive public health problem for which millions of Americans will access treatment. Training, practice, and research in substance use traditionally have not been a focus for counseling psychologists. Thus, many in our field do not feel adequately trained to work with clients who have substance use disorders. Counseling psychologists need to remain viable in a rapidly changing health care environment where treatment for substance use and mental health disorders have parity with other medical treatments. The goal of this article is a call to the profession to increase our presence in the field of substance use alongside other health care providers.

"Women engaging in transactional sex have disproportional mental health co-morbidity and face substantial barriers to accessing social services. We hypothesized that participation in a longitudinal research study, with no overt intervention, would lead to short-term mental health improvements. For 4-weeks, 24 women disclosed information about their lives via twice daily cell-phone diaries and weekly interviews. We used t tests to compare self-esteem, anxiety, and depression at baseline and exit. Tests were repeated for hypothesized effect modifiers (e.g., substance abuse severity; age of sex work debut). For particularly vulnerable women (e.g., less educated, histories of abuse, younger initiation of sex work) participation in research conferred unanticipated mental health benefits. Positive interactions with researchers, as well as discussing lived experiences, may explain these effects. Additional studies are needed to confirm findings and identify mechanisms of change.

"IMPORTANCE Perinatal complications may increase the risk of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Previous reports were based on small, retrospective, specialist clinic-based studies that were unable to rigorously control for unmeasured environmental and genetic confounding. OBJECTIVE To prospectively investigate a wide range of potential perinatal risk factors for OCD, controlling for unmeasured factors shared between siblings in the analyses. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This population-based birth cohort study included all 2421284 children from singleton births in Sweden from January 1, 1973, to December 31, 1996, who were followed up through December 31, 2013. From the 1403651 families in the cohort, differentially exposed siblings from the 743885 families with siblings were evaluated; of these, 11 592 families included clusters of full siblings that were discordant for OCD. Analysis of the data was conducted from January, 26, 2015, to September, 5, 2016. EXPOSURES Perinatal data were collected from the Swedish Medical Birth Register and included maternal smoking during pregnancy, labor presentation, obstetric delivery, gestational age (for preterm birth), birth weight, birth weight in relation to gestational age, 5-minute Apgar score, and head circumference. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Previously validated OCD codes (International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Health Related Problems, Tenth Revision, code F42) in the Swedish National Patient Register. RESULTS Of 2 421 284 individuals included in the cohort, 17 305 persons were diagnosed with OCD. Of these, 7111 were men (41.1%). The mean (SD) age of individuals at first diagnosis of OCD was 23.4 (6.5) years. An increased risk for OCD remained after controlling for shared familial confounders and measured covariates (including sex, year of birth, maternal and paternal age at birth, and parity), for smoking 10 or more cigarettes per day during pregnancy (hazard ratio [HR], 1.27; 95% CI, 1.02-1.58), breech presentation (HR, 1.35; 95% CI, 1.06-1.71), delivery by cesarean section (HR, 1.17; 95% CI, 1.01-1.34), preterm birth (HR, 1.24; 95% CI, 1.07-1.43), birth weight 1501 to 2500 g (HR, 1.30; 95% CI, 1.05-1.62) and 2501 to 3500 g (HR, 1.08; 95% CI, 1.01-1.16), being large for gestational age (HR, 1.23; 95% CI, 1.05-1.45), and Apgar distress scores at 5 minutes (HR, 1.50; 95% CI, 1.07-2.09). Gestational age and birth weight followed inverse dose-response associations, whereby an increasingly higher risk for OCD was noted in children with a shorter gestational age and lower birth weight. We also observed a dose-response association between the number of perinatal events and increased OCD risk, with HRs ranging from 1.11 (95% CI, 1.07-1.15) for 1 event to 1.51 (95% CI, 1.18-1.94) for 5 or more events. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE A range of perinatal risk factors is associated with a higher risk for OCD independent of shared familial confounders, suggesting that perinatal risk factors may be in the causal pathway to OCD.",,"Rosenqvist, Mina/P-6531-2018; Serlachius, Eva/E-8956-2013","Almqvist, C|Brander, G|D'Onofrio, BM|Fernandez de la Cruz, L|Kuja-Halkola, R|Larsson, H|Lichtenstein, P|Mataix-Cols, D|Ruck, C|Rydell, M|Serlachius, E","Almqvist, Catarina|Brander, Gustaf|D'Onofrio, Brian M.|Fernandez de la Cruz, Lorena|Kuja-Halkola, Ralf|Larsson, Henrik|Lichtenstein, Paul|Mataix-Cols, David|Ruck, Christian|Rydell, Mina|Serlachius, Eva",1135,-1,,,,,,,-1,,-1,,,,,,,,Article,10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2016.2095,,,,1144,Clarivate Analytics Web of Science,,,,,,2168-622X,11,,,JAMA PSYCHIATRY,,,,ENVIRONMENTAL-FACTORS|MOLECULAR-GENETICS|BRAIN-DEVELOPMENT|MATERNAL SMOKING|FETAL|DISCORDANT|PREGNANCY|SYMPTOMS|REGISTER|BEHAVIOR,-1,"Rosenqvist, Mina/0000-0002-2788-2061; Serlachius, Eva/0000-0001-7115-6422; Kuja-Halkola, Ralf/0000-0002-3765-2067",,,NOV,J,2016,,,,,,Psychiatry,,-1,,Psychiatry,,6,"Association of Perinatal Risk Factors With Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder A Population-Based Birth Cohort, Sibling Control Study",7,,WOS:000387927400008,1,73,2168-6238,27706475,C:\Users\mginda\Desktop\agc1\wos-extract.isi,"Brander G, 2016, V73, P1135, DOI 10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2016.2095"
"Background: In 2014, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Office of Population Affairs released a document entitled Providing Quality Family Planning Services (QFP), which outlined recommendations for delivery of family planning services using a client-centered approach. These aimed to standardize service provision and address numerous reproductive health challenges. To date, little is known about QFP implementation or the factors influencing its adoption by clinicians. Study Design: Semistructured interviews were conducted with 16 family planning providers at Title X-funded clinics in Indiana and Missouri to measure provider attitudes toward the QFP, their influence on adoption of the recommendations, and other barriers to QFP implementation. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and analyzed in Nvivo. Using the diffusion of innovation theory as a framework, we identify themes related to innovation adoption. Results: Findings suggest that a provider's values related to client-centered counseling and views regarding the relative advantage of the QFP are key factors influencing adoption. Participants identified a number of structural and interpersonal barriers to implementation including misinterpretation of the QFP and billing issues. Conclusions: Although participants expressed that QFP was an improvement over previous guidelines, misalignment of the recommendations with professional values and experiences, lack of clarity of the guidelines, and logistical issues serve as major barriers to adoption and implementation. These findings inform our understanding of policy adoption. Increased training and precise messaging is necessary to improve adoption of QFP at Title X clinics.

"Background: Increased trade between China and Uganda has fueled trafficking of female Ugandans into China. These women may face challenges accessing health services. This study focused on examining barriers to health care access among female Ugandan sex workers in China. Methods: In 2014, we undertook in-depth interviews with 19 female Ugandan sex workers in Guangzhou, China. Interviews focused on barriers to health service access and were analyzed using an a priori coding framework followed by open-coding to capture emergent themes. Results: Out of 19 women, 12 women reported a history of being trafficked into China. None of the women had a valid Chinese visa. Fear of being arrested for lack of documentation discouraged women in this sample from accessing hospital services. Low pay, housing exploitation, and remittances contributed to participants' lack of financial resources, which further inhibited their ability to access health services. Participants expressed feeling social isolation from the local community and reported mistrust of local individuals and organizations, including hospitals. Conclusion: Ugandan sex workers in China faced substantial structural barriers that limited health service access.

"Children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are at increased risk of problematic alcohol and other substance use in adolescence. This study used data from an ongoing, prospective, population-based twin study of Swedish children and adolescents to evaluate the extent to which the association between ADHD symptoms and alcohol problems reflects a unique source of genetic or environmental risk related to ADHD versus a broader predisposition to youth externalizing behavior. We used all available data from same-sex monozygotic (MZ) and dizygotic (DZ) twins on ADHD symptoms in childhood (age 9/12; N = 15,549) and alcohol problems in late adolescence (age 18; N = 2,564). Consistent with prior longitudinal studies, the phenotypic association between hyperactive/impulsive ADHD symptoms and alcohol problems was small in magnitude, whereas the association for inattentive symptoms was even weaker. Additive genetic influences explained 99.8% of the association between hyperactive/impulsive symptoms and alcohol problems. Furthermore, we found that the genetic risk specifically associated with hyperactive/impulsive symptoms was attenuated when estimated in the context of externalizing behavior liability during childhood, of which ADHD symptoms were specific expressions. In sensitivity analyses exploring hyperactivity in mid-adolescence, we found a similar pattern of genetic associations. These results are consistent with previous findings of genetically driven overlap in the etiology of ADHD and problematic alcohol use. At least some of this co-occurrence may result from a general predisposition to externalizing behaviors in youth.

Bivariate quantitative genetic modelling in (1) full brothers and maternal half-brothers, (2) full brothers reared together and apart and (3) monozygotic and dizygotic twin brothers was used to estimate genetic and environmental correlations. SettingRegister-based study in Sweden. ParticipantsThe full sample included 1 402 333 Swedish men born 1958-91 and conscripted at mean age 18.2 [standard deviation (SD)=0.5] years. A total of 1 361 066 men who had no substance misuse events before cognitive assessment at mandatory military conscription were included in the Cox regression models, with a follow-up time of up to 35.6years. MeasuresCognitive ability was assessed at conscription with the Swedish Enlistment Battery. Substance misuse events included alcohol- and drug-related court convictions, medical treatments and deaths, available from governmental registries. FindingsLower cognitive ability in late adolescence predicted an increased risk for substance misuse events [hazard ratio (HR) for a 1-stanine unit decrease in cognitive ability: 1.29, 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.29-1.30]. The association was somewhat attenuated within clusters of full brothers (HR=1.21, 95% CI=1.20-1.23). Quantitative genetic analyses indicated that the association was due primarily to genetic influences; the genetic correlations ranged between -0.39 (95% CI=-0.45, -0.34) and -0.52 (95% CI -0.55, -0.48) in the three different designs. ConclusionsShared genetic influences appear to underlie the association between low cognitive ability and subsequent risk for substance misuse events among Swedish men.",,,"D'Onofrio, BM|Kuja-Halkola, R|Larsson, H|Latvala, A|Lichtenstein, P","D'Onofrio, Brian M.|Kuja-Halkola, Ralf|Larsson, Henrik|Latvala, Antti|Lichtenstein, Paul",1814,-1,,,,,,,-1,,-1,,,,,,,,Article,10.1111/add.13440,,,,1822,Clarivate Analytics Web of Science,,,,,,0965-2140,10,,,ADDICTION,,,,SWEDISH ENLISTMENT BATTERY|CONSTRUCT-VALIDITY|EARLY ADULTHOOD|TWIN|INTELLIGENCE|ASSOCIATION|DEPRIVATION|POPULATION|DISORDERS|ORIGINS,-1,"Kuja-Halkola, Ralf/0000-0002-3765-2067",Cognitive ability|family study|longitudinal study|quantitative genetic analysis|register-based research|substance misuse,,OCT,J,2016,,,,,,Substance Abuse|Psychiatry,,-1,,Substance Abuse; Psychiatry,,2,Cognitive ability and risk for substance misuse in men: genetic and environmental correlations in a longitudinal nation-wide family study,2,,WOS:000383713500025,1,111,1360-0443,27106532,C:\Users\mginda\Desktop\agc1\wos-extract.isi,"Latvala A, 2016, V111, P1814, DOI 10.1111/add.13440"
"ObjectiveSmoking is highly prevalent among individuals with drug and alcohol disorders. Concurrent tobacco dependence treatment during substance use disorder (SUD) treatment is supported, yet the association between SUD treatment outcomes and smoking status has been understudied in minorities, including Latinos. MethodParticipants were 322 Spanish-speaking Latinos enrolled in a SUD treatment study in 5 U.S. cities. Logistic regression examined associations between baseline smoking status and treatment outcomes for nontobacco substance use at follow-up. Covariates included age, gender, level of education, marital status, treatment group, and mandated treatment status. ResultsResults indicated smokers had a reduced likelihood of abstinence for all nontobacco substances (p = .001) and their primary drug of use (p = .007). ConclusionsFindings contribute to the growing literature indicating a possible beneficial effect of smoking cessation services on SUD treatment, specifically among Latinos.

"Objective: To replicate and extend a study by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) and Rutgers on antipsychotic use among youths in Medicaid, the authors analyzed Indiana Medicaid claims from 2004 to 2012, extending the earlier study by focusing on second-generation antipsychotics, including both fee-for-service (FFS) and non-FFS patients, and analyzing cost trends. Methods: The authors evaluated the impact of several Indiana Medicaid policy changes on medication utilization and cost among children enrolled for at least one month during 2004-2012 (N=683,716-793,637), using an exhaustive antipsychotic list to search the database. Results: Annual utilization rates for antipsychotics were 2%-3% but were much higher among foster children (10%-15%). Policies implemented in 2007 or later were associated with a significant plateauing of utilization in 2008-2012. Conclusions: Growth of second-generation antipsychotic utilization and costs was similar to trends described in the AHRQ-Rutgers study.

"IMPORTANCE Induction of labor is a frequently performed obstetrical intervention. It would thus be of great concern if reported associations between labor induction and offspring risk of autism spectrum disorders (ASD) reflected causal influence. OBJECTIVE To assess the associations of labor induction with ASD, comparing differentially exposed relatives (siblings and cousins discordant for induction). DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Follow-up of all live births in Sweden between 1992 and 2005, defined in the Medical Birth Register. The register was linked to population registers of familial relations, inpatient and outpatient visits, and education records. Diagnoses of ASD were from 2001 through 2013, and data were analyzed in the 2015-2016 year. EXPOSURES Induction of labor. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Autism spectrum disorders identified by diagnoses from inpatient and outpatient records between 2001 and 2013. Hazard ratios (HRs) quantified the association between labor induction and offspring ASD. In addition to considering a wide range of measured confounders, comparison of exposure-discordant births to the same woman allowed additional control for all unmeasured factors shared by siblings. RESULTS The full cohort included 1 362 950 births, of which 22 077 offspring (1.6%) were diagnosed with ASD by ages 8 years through 21 years. In conventional models of the full cohort, associations between labor induction and offspring ASD were attenuated but remained statistically significant after adjustment for measured potential confounders (HR, 1.19; 95% CI, 1.13-1.24). When comparison was made within siblings whose births were discordant with respect to induction, thus accounting for all environmental and genetic factors shared by siblings, labor induction was no longer associated with offspring ASD (HR, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.88-1.10). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this nationwide sample of live births we observed no association between induction of labor and offspring ASD within sibling comparison. Our findings suggest that concern for ASD should not factor into the clinical decision about whether to induce labor.",,,"Almqvist, C|Bateman, BT|D'Onofrio, BM|Ecker, JL|Hernandez-Diaz, S|Larsson, H|Lichtenstein, P|Oberg, AS|Rickert, ME","Almqvist, Catarina|Bateman, Brian T.|D'Onofrio, Brian M.|Ecker, Jeffrey L.|Hernandez-Diaz, Sonia|Larsson, Henrik|Lichtenstein, Paul|Oberg, Anna S.|Rickert, Martin",,-1,,,,,,,-1,,-1,,,,,,,,Article,10.1001/jamapediatrics.2016.0965,,,,,Clarivate Analytics Web of Science,,,,,,2168-6203,9,,,JAMA PEDIATRICS,,,e160965,POPULATION|OXYTOCIN|DESIGNS,-1,,,,SEP,J,2016,,,,,,Pediatrics,,-1,,Pediatrics,,3,Association of Labor Induction With Offspring Risk of Autism Spectrum Disorders,3,,WOS:000384212700001,1,170,2168-6211,27454803,C:\Users\mginda\Desktop\agc1\wos-extract.isi,"Oberg AS, 2016, V170, DOI 10.1001/jamapediatrics.2016.0965"
"Differences in risk behaviours between men who have sex with men (MSM) and men who have sex with both men and women (MSMW) have important implications for HIV and sexually transmitted infection (STI) transmission. We examined differences in risk behaviours, HIV/STI testing, self-reported HIV/STI diagnoses, and linkage to HIV care between MSM and MSMW across China. Participants were recruited through three MSM-focused websites in China. An online survey containing items on socio-demographics, risk behaviours, testing history, self-reported HIV/STI diagnosis, and linkage to and retention in HIV care was completed from September to October 2014. Chi square tests and logistic regression analyses were conducted. MSMW were less likely to use a condom during last anal sex (p0.01) and more likely to engage in group sex (p0.01) and transactional sex (p0.01) compared to MSM. Self-reported HIV/STI testing and positivity rates between MSM and MSMW were similar. Among HIV-infected MSM, there was no difference in rates of linkage to or retention in antiretroviral therapy when comparing MSM and MSMW. Chinese MSM and MSMW may benefit from different HIV and STI intervention and prevention strategies. Achieving a successful decrease in HIV/STI epidemics among Chinese MSM and MSMW will depend on the ability of targeted and culturally congruent HIV/STI control programmes to facilitate a reduction in risk behaviours.",,,"Aalsma, MC|Best, J|Davis, A|Dodge, B|Luo, JH|Meyerson, BE|Tucker, JD|Van der Pol, BJ|Wei, CY","Aalsma, Matthew C.|Best, John|Davis, Alissa|Dodge, Brian|Luo, Juhua|Meyerson, Beth E.|Tucker, Joseph D.|Van der Pol, Barbara J.|Wei, Chongyi",840,-1,,,,,,,-1,,-1,,,,,,,,Article,10.1177/0956462415596302,,,,849,Clarivate Analytics Web of Science,,,Social Entrepreneurship Sexual,,,0956-4624,10,,,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF STD & AIDS,,,,HIV-INFECTION|BISEXUAL MEN|UNITED-STATES|MEDICAL-CARE|POPULATION|SYPHILIS|HEALTH|INTERVENTION|METAANALYSIS|LINKAGE,-1,"Tucker, Joseph/0000-0003-2804-1181; Han, Larry/0000-0002-0577-9661",HIV|AIDS|sexually transmitted infection|STI|men who have sex with men|men who have sex with both men and women|condom use|risk behaviours|China,,SEP,J,2016,,,,,,Immunology|Infectious Diseases,,-1,,Immunology; Infectious Diseases,,2,"Differences in risk behaviours, HIV/STI testing and HIV/STI prevalence between men who have sex with men and men who have sex with both men and women in China",2,,WOS:000382931900003,1,27,1758-1052,26185041,C:\Users\mginda\Desktop\agc1\wos-extract.isi,"Davis A, 2016, V27, P840, DOI 10.1177/0956462415596302"
"Previous research suggests that fussy temperament in infancy predicts risk for later antisocial behavior (ASB) in childhood and adolescence. It remains unclear, however, to what extent infant fussiness is related to later ASB through causal processes or if they both reflect the same family risk factors for ASB. The current study used two approaches, the comparison of siblings and bivariate biometric modeling, to reduce familial confounding and examine genetic and environmental influences on associations between fussiness in the first 2 years of life and ASB in childhood and late adolescence. Analyses were conducted on data from a prospective cohort (9237 at 4-9 years and 7034 at 14-17 years) who are the offspring of a nationally representative sample of US women. In the full sample, fussiness predicted both child and adolescent ASB to small but significant extents, controlling for a wide range of measured child and family-level covariates. When siblings who differed in their fussiness were compared, fussiness predicted ASB in childhood, but not ASB during adolescence. Furthermore, results from a bivariate Cholesky model suggested that even the association of fussiness with childhood ASB found when comparing siblings is attributable to familial factors. That is, although families with infants who are higher in fussiness also tend to have children and adolescents who engage in greater ASB, the hypothesis that infant fussiness has an environmentally mediated impact on the development of future ASB was not strongly supported.",,,"Donahue, KL|D'Onofrio, BM|Goodnight, JA|Lahey, BB|Rathouz, PJ|Van Hulle, CA|Waldman, ID","Donahue, Kelly L.|D'Onofrio, Brian M.|Goodnight, Jackson A.|Lahey, Benjamin B.|Rathouz, Paul J.|Van Hulle, Carol A.|Waldman, Irwin D.",680,-1,,,,,,,-1,,-1,,,,,,,,Article,10.1007/s10519-016-9794-2,,,,692,Clarivate Analytics Web of Science,,,,,,0001-8244,5,,,BEHAVIOR GENETICS,,,,CONDUCT PROBLEMS|TWIN|DELINQUENCY|HYPOTHESES|PREDICTORS|DISORDERS|CHILDREN|MOTHER|MALES|YOUTH,-1,,Conduct problems|Temperament|Delinquency|Sibling comparison|Quasiexperimental|Irritability|Fussiness,,SEP,J,2016,,,,,,"Behavioral Sciences|Genetics & Heredity|Psychology, Multidisciplinary",,-1,,Behavioral Sciences; Genetics & Heredity; Psychology,,2,Genetic and Environmental Contributions to Associations between Infant Fussy Temperament and Antisocial Behavior in Childhood and Adolescence,2,,WOS:000381224400006,1,46,1573-3297,27105627,C:\Users\mginda\Desktop\agc1\wos-extract.isi,"Goodnight JA, 2016, V46, P680, DOI 10.1007/s10519-016-9794-2"
"Although United States smoking rates have been on the decline over the past few decades, cigarette smoking still poses a critical health and economic threat. Very few treatment options for smoking exist, and many of them do not lead to long-term abstinence. Preclinical models are necessary for understanding the effects of nicotine and developing treatments. Current self-administration models of nicotine intake may require surgical procedures and often result in low levels of intake. Further, they do not lend themselves to investigating treatments. The current study sought to develop a limited-access model of nicotine intake using the Drinking-in-the-Dark paradigm, which results in high levels of binge-like ethanol consumption that can be pharmacologically manipulated. The present study found that mice will consume nicotine under a range of parameters. Intakes under the preferred condition of 0.14 mg/ml nicotine in 0.2% saccharin reached over 6 mg/kg in two hours and were reduced by an injection of R(+)-baclofen. Mecamylamine did not significantly affect nicotine consumption. As nicotine and ethanol are often co-abused, nicotine intake was also tested in the presence of ethanol. When presented in the same bottle, mice altered nicotine intake under various concentrations to maintain consistent levels of ethanol intake. When nicotine and ethanol were presented in separate bottles, mice greatly reduced their nicotine intake while maintaining ethanol intake. In conclusion, these studies characterize a novel model of limited-access nicotine intake that can be pharmacologically manipulated. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

"Background Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is the leading cause of disability and mortality in children and young adults worldwide. It remains unclear, however, how TBI in childhood and adolescence is associated with adult mortality, psychiatric morbidity, and social outcomes. Methods and Findings In a Swedish birth cohort between 1973 and 1985 of 1,143,470 individuals, we identified all those who had sustained at least one TBI (n = 104,290 or 9.1%) up to age 25 y and their unaffected siblings (n = 68,268) using patient registers. We subsequently assessed these individuals for the following outcomes using multiple national registries: disability pension, specialist diagnoses of psychiatric disorders and psychiatric inpatient hospitalisation, premature mortality (before age 41 y), low educational attainment (not having achieved secondary school qualifications), and receiving means-tested welfare benefits. We used logistic and Cox regression models to quantify the association between TBI and specified adverse outcomes on the individual level. We further estimated population attributable fractions (PAF) for each outcome measure. We also compared differentially exposed siblings to account for unobserved genetic and environmental confounding. In addition to relative risk estimates, we examined absolute risks by calculating prevalence and Kaplan-Meier estimates. In complementary analyses, we tested whether the findings were moderated by injury severity, recurrence, and age at first injury (ages 0-4, 5-9, 6-10, 15-19, and 20-24 y). TBI exposure was associated with elevated risks of impaired adult functioning across all outcome measures. After a median follow-up period of 8 y from age 26 y, we found that TBI contributed to absolute risks of over 10% for specialist diagnoses of psychiatric disorders and low educational attainment, approximately 5% for disability pension, and 2% for premature mortality. The highest relative risks, adjusted for sex, birth year, and birth order, were found for psychiatric inpatient hospitalisation (adjusted relative risk [aRR] = 2.0; 95% CI: 1.9-2.0; 6,632 versus 37,095 events), disability pension (aRR = 1.8; 95% CI: 1.7-1.8; 4,691 versus 29,778 events), and premature mortality (aRR = 1.7; 95% CI: 1.6-1.9; 799 versus 4,695 events). These risks were only marginally attenuated when the comparisons were made with their unaffected siblings, which implies that the effects of TBI were consistent with a causal inference. A dose-response relationship was observed with injury severity. Injury recurrence was also associated with higher risks-in particular, for disability pension we found that recurrent TBI was associated with a 3-fold risk increase (aRR = 2.6; 95% CI: 2.4-2.8) compared to a single-episode TBI. Higher risks for all outcomes were observed for those who had sustained their first injury at an older age (ages 20-24 y) with more than 25% increase in relative risk across all outcomes compared to the youngest age group (ages 0-4 y). On the population level, TBI explained between 2%-6% of the variance in the examined outcomes. Using hospital data underestimates milder forms of TBI, but such misclassification bias suggests that the reported estimates are likely conservative. The sibling-comparison design accounts for unmeasured familial confounders shared by siblings, including half of their genes. Thus, residual genetic confounding remains a possibility but will unlikely alter our main findings, as associations were only marginally attenuated within families. Conclusions Given our findings, which indicate potentially causal effects between TBI exposure in childhood and later impairments across a range of health and social outcomes, age-sensitive clinical guidelines should be considered and preventive strategies should be targeted at children and adolescents.",,,"D'Onofrio, BM|Fazel, S|Larsson, H|Sariaslan, A|Sharp, DJ","D'Onofrio, Brian M.|Fazel, Seena|Larsson, Henrik|Sariaslan, Amir|Sharp, David J.",,-1,,,,,,,-1,,-1,,,,,,,,Article,10.1371/journal.pmed.1002103,,,,,Clarivate Analytics Web of Science,,,,,,1549-1676,8,,,PLOS MEDICINE,,,e1002103,PROFESSIONAL FOOTBALL PLAYERS|SPORT-RELATED CONCUSSION|PSYCHIATRIC-DISORDERS|YOUNG-CHILDREN|HEAD-INJURY|FOLLOW-UP|POPULATION|RISK|PREDICTORS|DISABILITY,-1,,,,AUG,J,2016,,,,,,"Medicine, General & Internal",,-1,,General & Internal Medicine,,25,Long-Term Outcomes Associated with Traumatic Brain Injury in Childhood and Adolescence: A Nationwide Swedish Cohort Study of a Wide Range of Medical and Social Outcomes,25,,WOS:000383357400020,1,13,,27552147,C:\Users\mginda\Desktop\agc1\wos-extract.isi,"Sariaslan A, 2016, V13, DOI 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002103"
"FKBP5 encodes FK506-binding protein 5, a glucocorticoid receptor (GR)-binding protein implicated in various psychiatric disorders and alcohol withdrawal severity. The purpose of this study is to characterize alcohol preference and related phenotypes in Fkbp5 knockout (KO) mice and to examine the role of FKBP5 in human alcohol consumption. The following experiments were performed to characterize Fkpb5 KO mice. (1) Fkbp5 KO and wild-type (WT) EtOH consumption was tested using a two-bottle choice paradigm; (2) The EtOH elimination rate was measured after intraperitoneal (IP) injection of 2.0 g/kg EtOH; (3) Blood alcohol concentration (BAC) was measured after 3 h limited access of alcohol; (4) Brain region expression of Fkbp5 was identified using LacZ staining; (5) Baseline corticosterone (CORT) was assessed. Additionally, two SNPs, rs1360780 (C/T) and rs3800373 (T/G), were selected to study the association of FKBP5 with alcohol consumption in humans. Participants were college students (n = 1162) from 21-26 years of age with Chinese, Korean or Caucasian ethnicity. The results, compared to WT mice, for KO mice exhibited an increase in alcohol consumption that was not due to differences in taste sensitivity or alcohol metabolism. Higher BAC was found in KO mice after 3 h of EtOH access. Fkbp5 was highly expressed in brain regions involved in the regulation of the stress response, such as the hippocampus, amygdala, dorsal raphe and locus coeruleus. Both genotypes exhibited similar basal levels of plasma corticosterone (CORT). Finally, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in FKBP5 were found to be associated with alcohol drinking in humans.

"Background: Obesity is a public health concern in the United States due to its increasing prevalence, especially in younger age groups. Trauma is the most common cause of death for people under aged 40 y. The purpose of this study is to determine the association between obesity and specific infectious complications after traumatic injury. Materials and methods: A retrospective analysis was conducted using data from the 2012 National Trauma Data Bank. The National Trauma Data Bank defined obesity as having a body mass index of 30 or greater. Descriptive statistics were calculated and stratified by obesity status. A hierarchical regression model was used to determine the odds of experiencing an infectious complication in patients with obesity while controlling for age, gender, diabetes, number of comorbidities, injury severity, injury mechanism, head injury, and surgical procedure. Results: Patients with a body mass index of 30 or greater compared with nonobese patients had increased odds of having an infectious complication (Odds Ratio, 1.59; 1.49-1.69). In addition to obesity, injury severity score greater than 29, age 40 y or older, diabetes, comorbid conditions, and having a surgical procedure were also predictive of an infectious complication. Conclusions: Our results indicate that trauma patients with obesity are nearly 60% more likely to develop an infectious complication in the hospital. Infection prevention and control measures should be implemented soon after hospital arrival for patients with obesity, particularly those with operative trauma. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this work was to compare the academic impact of trauma surgery faculty relative to faculty in general surgery and other surgery subspecialties. METHODS: Scholarly metrics were determined for 4,015 faculty at the top 50 National Institutes of Health (NIH)-funded university-based departments and five hospital-based surgery departments. RESULTS: Overall, 317 trauma surgical faculty (8.2%) were identified. This compared to 703 other general surgical faculty (18.2%) and 2,830 other subspecialty surgical faculty (73.5%). The average size of the trauma surgical division was six faculty. Overall, 43% were assistant professors, 29% were associate professors, and 28% were full professors, while 3.1% had PhD, 2.5% had MD and PhD, and, 16.3% were division chiefs/directors. Compared with general surgery, there were no differences regarding faculty academic levels or leadership positions. Other surgical specialties had more full professors (39% vs. 28%; p < 0.05) and faculty with research degrees (PhD, 7.7%; and MD and PhD, 5.7%). Median publications/citations were lower, especially for junior trauma surgical faculty (T) compared with general surgery (G) and other (O) surgical specialties: assistant professors (T, 9 publications/76 citations vs. G, 13/138, and O, 18/241; p < 0.05), associate professors (T, 22/351 vs. G, 36/700, and O, 47/846; p < 0.05), and professors (T, 88/2,234 vs. G, 93/2193; p = NS [not significant for either publications/citations] and O, 99/2425; p = NS). Publications/Citations for division chiefs/directors were comparable with other specialties: T, 77/1,595 vs. G, 103/2,081 and O, 74/1,738; p = NS, but were lower for all nonchief faculty; T, 23/368 vs. G, 30/528 and O, 37/658; p < 0.05. Trauma surgical faculty were less likely to have current or former NIH funding than other surgical specialties (17 % vs. 27%; p < 0.05), and this included a lower rate of R01/U01/P01 funding (5.5% vs. 10.8%; p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Senior trauma surgical faculty are as academically productive as other general surgical faculty and other surgical specialists. Junior trauma faculty, however, publish at a lower rate than other general surgery or subspecialty faculty. Causes of decreased academic productivity and lower NIH funding must be identified, understood, and addressed. Copyright (C) 2016 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

"BACKGROUND: The objective of this study was to characterize potential disparities in academic output, NIH-funding, and academic rank between male and female surgical faculty and identify subspecialties in which these differences may be more pronounced. STUDY DESIGN: Eighty metrics for 4,015 faculty members at the top-55 NIH-funded departments of surgery were collected. Demographic characteristics, NIH funding details, and scholarly output were analyzed. A new metric, academic velocity (V), reflecting recent citations is defined. RESULTS: Overall, 21.5% of surgical faculty are women. The percentage of female faculty is highest in science/research (41%) and surgical oncology (34%), and lowest in cardiothoracic surgery (9%). Female faculty are less likely to be full professors (22.7% vs 41.2%) and division chiefs (6.2% vs 13.6%). The fraction of women who are full professors is lowest in cardiothoracic surgery. Overall median numbers of publications/citations are lower for female faculty compared with male surgical faculty (21 of 364 vs 43 of 723, p < 0.001), and these differences are more pronounced for assistant professors. Current/previous NIH funding (21.3% vs 24%, p = NS) rates are similar between women and men, and surgical departments with more female full professors have higher NIH funding ranking (R-2 = 0.14, p < 0.05). In certain subspecialties, female associate and full professors outperform male counterparts. Overall, female authors have higher numbers of more recent citations. CONCLUSIONS: Subspecialty involvement and academic performance differences by sex vary greatly by subspecialty type and are most pronounced at the assistant professor level. Identification of potential barriers for entry of women into certain subspecialties, causes for the observed lower number of publications/citations among female assistant professors, and obstacles for attaining leadership roles need to be determined. We propose a new metric for assessment of publications/citations that can offset the effects of seniority differences between male and female faculty members.

"Cigarette use is a prominent problem in juvenile offenders, leading to negative health outcomes and substance use. One interesting precipitator of cigarette use in this population is discrimination. Social support could potentially buffer the positive relationship between cigarette use and discrimination in juvenile offenders, which could be dependent on the context in which the discrimination is experienced, such as peer, institutional (e.g., stores, restaurants), or educational contexts. The present study explored the relationship between three types of discrimination, social support, and smoking outcomes among 112 detained and probated juvenile offenders (mean age = 16.24, SD = 2.11, 29.2% female, 54.9% Caucasian, 40.4% detention, 53.8% smokers). Results indicated that the relationship between institutional discrimination (OR = -0.10, p = 0.005) and peer discrimination (OR = -0.11, p = 0.01) were significantly moderated by social support, with a higher likelihood of being a smoker, compared to a non-smoker at higher levels of peer and institutional discrimination. Further, based on a moderated regression analysis, results indicated that youth who experienced greater educational discrimination and lower levels of social support, they were at higher risk of nicotine addiction (b = -0.09, p = 0.03). Overall, results indicate that varying avenues of social support, such as parent, peer, and teacher support, can mitigate negative effects of discrimination on juvenile offenders, particularly cigarette use. Addressing discrimination in smoking treatment and prevention in juvenile offenders may be of great utility. Future studies should examine the potential mechanisms underlying the discrimination and cigarette use connection in juvenile offenders. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

"BACKGROUND In January 2015, a total of 11 new diagnoses of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection were reported in a small community in Indiana. We investigated the extent and cause of the outbreak and implemented control measures. METHODS We identified an outbreak-related case as laboratory-confirmed HIV infection newly diagnosed after October 1, 2014, in a person who either resided in Scott County, Indiana, or was named by another case patient as a syringe-sharing or sexual partner. HIV polymerase (pol) sequences from case patients were phylogenetically analyzed, and potential risk factors associated with HIV infection were ascertained. RESULTS From November 18, 2014, to November 1, 2015, HIV infection was diagnosed in 181 case patients. Most of these patients (87.8%) reported having injected the extended-release formulation of the prescription opioid oxymorphone, and 92.3% were coinfected with hepatitis C virus. Among 159 case patients who had an HIV type 1 pol gene sequence, 157 (98.7%) had sequences that were highly related, as determined by phylogenetic analyses. Contact tracing investigations led to the identification of 536 persons who were named as contacts of case patients; 468 of these contacts (87.3%) were located, assessed for risk, tested for HIV, and, if infected, linked to care. The number of times a contact was named as a syringe-sharing partner by a case patient was significantly associated with the risk of HIV infection (adjusted risk ratio for each time named, 1.9; P< 0.001). In response to this outbreak, a public health emergency was declared on March 26, 2015, and a syringe-service program in Indiana was established for the first time. CONCLUSIONS Injection-drug use of extended-release oxymorphone within a network of persons who inject drugs in Indiana led to the introduction and rapid transmission of HIV.

"BACKGROUND: Because of the unique physiology and comorbidities of injured geriatric patients, specific interventions are needed to improve outcomes. The purpose of this study was to assess the effect of a change in triage criteria for injured geriatric patients evaluated at an American College of Surgeons Level I trauma center. METHODS: As of October 1, 2013, all injured patients 70 years or older were mandated to have the highest-level trauma activation upon emergency department (ED) arrival regardless of physiology or mechanism of injury. Patients admitted before that date were designated as PRE; those admitted after were designated as POST. The study period was from October 1, 2011, through April 30, 2015. Data collected included demographics, mechanism of injury, hypotension on admission, comorbidities, Injury Severity Score (ISS), ED length of stay (LOS), complications, and mortality. Bivariate and multivariable analyses were used to compare outcomes between the study groups (p < 0.05 was considered significant). chi(2) or Fisher's exact test was used as appropriate for bivariate analyses of categorical variables; patients' ages were compared using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test. RESULTS: A total of 2,269 patients (mean, 80.63 years; mean ISS, 12.2; PRE, 1,271; POST, 933) were included in the study. On multivariable analysis, increasing age, higher ISS, and hypotension were associated with higher mortality. POST patients were more likely to have an ED LOS of 2 hours or shorter (odds ratio, 1.614; 95% confidence interval, 1.088-2.394) after controlling for hypotension, ISS, and comorbidities. POST mortality significantly decreased (odds ratio, 0.689; 95% confidence interval, 0.484-0.979). CONCLUSION: Based on age alone, the focused intervention of a higher level of trauma activation decreased ED LOS and mortality in injured geriatric patients.

"As adolescents gain freedom to explore new environments unsupervised, more time in proximity to alcohol outlets may increase risks for alcohol and marijuana use. This pilot study: 1) Describes variations in adolescents' proximity to outlets by time of day and day of the week, 2) Examines variations in outlet proximity by drinking and marijuana use status, and 3) Tests feasibility of obtaining real-time data to study adolescent proximity to outlets. U.S. adolescents (N = 18) aged 16-17 (50% female) carried GPS-enabled smartphones for one week with their locations tracked. The geographic areas where adolescents spend time, activity spaces, were created by connecting GPS points sequentially and adding spatial buffers around routes. Proximity to outlets was greater during after school and evening hours. Drinkers and marijuana users were in proximity to outlets 11/2 to 2 times more than non-users. Findings provide information about where adolescents spend time and times of greatest risk, informing prevention efforts. (C) 2016 The Foundation for Professionals in Services for Adolescents.

"African American youth who experience racial discrimination are at heightened risk to use drugs as a coping response to distress. Based on the buffer-stress hypothesis, we proposed that parental support would attenuate this effect. Participants were 1,521 African American youth between 4th and 12th grade. As hypothesized, a mediation pathway was observed among racial discrimination, depression symptoms, and drug use. This effect was observed for both genders, although the pathway was partially mediated for males. In addition, as hypothesized, parental support buffered the negative effect of depression symptomatology on drug use as a consequence of discrimination. Our findings highlight the impact racial discrimination has on health outcomes for African American youth and the importance of managing youths' emotional responses to discrimination. Moreover, findings illuminate the protective role of supportive parenting within the risk model and should thus be considered as an important component within prevention programming for this population of youth.",,,"Barnes, J|Fisher, S|Hsu, WW|Zapolski, TCB","Barnes, Jessica|Fisher, Sycarah|Hsu, Wei-Wen|Zapolski, Tamika C.

"Introduction: The purpose of the study was to better understand early risk for positive smoking expectancies, which have been shown to be consistent predictors of smoking initiation among youth. Two affect-based risk factors negative urgency and emotion dysregulation associated with smoking behaviors among youth, were examined for unique and interactive effects on positive smoking expectancies among substance-naive youth. Methods: Participants were 61 10-14-year-old children with virtually no drug use (less than 5 substance use incidents across the lifetime), who were drawn from the community. Results: Both negative urgency and emotion dysregulation were significantly associated with positive social facilitation smoking expectancies. Further, negative urgency was significantly related to positive social facilitation smoking expectancies at higher levels of emotion dysregulation (b = .09,p = .001). Conclusion: The findings provide evidence that both emotion dysregulation and negative urgency are positively associated with positive social-related smoking expectancies among a sample of 10-14-year-olds. Children who are emotionally dysregulated and who act rashly in response to negative emotions appear more likely to endorse beliefs regarding the socially enhancing effects of smoking, suggesting that these youth may be at high risk for smoking initiation.

"Background: Binge co-consumption of highly caffeinated energy drinks with alcohol (ethanol [EtOH]) has become a common practice among adolescents/young adults and has been associated with an increased incidence of hazardous behaviors. Animal models are critical in advancing our understanding the neurobehavioral consequences of this form of binge drinking. Surprisingly, virtually no work has explored caffeine and EtOH co-consumption or its long-term consequences in adolescent animals. The primary objective of the current study was to extend a previously established mouse model of voluntary binge caffeine and EtOH co-consumption to explore adolescent consumption and responses compared to adults. Methods: Adolescent and adult male C57BL/6J mice had daily limited access to caffeine (0.03% w/v), EtOH (20% v/v), a combined EtOH/caffeine solution, or water for 14 days via the binge-like drinking paradigm, drinking-in-the-dark (DID). Home cage locomotor activity was measured during DID in a subset of mice. Following DID, all mice rested for 18 days so that adolescents reached adulthood, whereupon all mice underwent 7 days of continuous access 2-bottle choice drinking for 10% (v/v) EtOH or water. Results: Co-consumption with caffeine significantly increased EtOH intake and resultant blood ethanol concentrations in both adolescent and adult mice. In addition, adolescent mice exhibited a uniquely robust locomotor stimulant response to caffeine and EtOH co-consumption. Later EtOH intake and preference was not influenced, however, by prior fluid consumption history via DID. Conclusions: Together with findings from the human literature, our results suggest that caffeine co-consumption may positively influence binge alcohol consumption in adolescents/young adults. Importantly, this age group may be particularly sensitive to the additive stimulant effects of caffeinated alcohol consumption, an effect which may be related to the high incidence of associated negative outcomes in this population. These observations are particularly concerning considering the heightened plasticity of the adolescent brain.",,,"Boehm, SL|Fritz, BM|Kasten, CR|Quoilin, C|Smoker, MP","Boehm, Stephen L., II|Fritz, Brandon M.|Kasten, Chelsea R.|Quoilin, Caroline|Smoker, Michael P.",1351,-1,,,,,,,-1,,-1,,,,,,,,Article,10.1111/acer.13089,,,,1360,Clarivate Analytics Web of Science,,,,,,0145-6008,6,,,ALCOHOLISM-CLINICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL RESEARCH,,,,ENERGY DRINK CONSUMPTION|DBA/2J MICE|BEHAVIORAL SENSITIZATION|SUBJECTIVE REPORTS|C57BL/6J MICE|RISK-TAKING|ALCOHOL|INTOXICATION|TOLERANCE|LOCOMOTOR,-1,"Kasten, Chelsea/0000-0002-6502-1051",Caffeine|Adolescent|Binge Drinking|Mice|Alcohol,,JUN,J,2016,,,,,,Substance Abuse,,-1,,Substance Abuse,,5,"Concomitant Caffeine Increases Binge Consumption of Ethanol in Adolescent and Adult Mice, But Produces Additive Motor Stimulation Only in Adolescent Animals",5,,WOS:000379811300023,1,40,1530-0277,27154344,C:\Users\mginda\Desktop\agc1\wos-extract.isi,"Fritz BM, 2016, V40, P1351, DOI 10.1111/acer.13089"
"Leaders in health professions education schools and programs are under pressure to respond to new accreditation requirements for interprofessional education (IPE). The work of creating and sustaining an IPE program at an academic health center is in many ways analogous to the challenge of creating and sustaining a ""commons""-a set of resources shared by many, but owned by none. In this Commentary, the authors borrow from the work of Nobel Laureate Elinor Ostrum to describe the ""design principles"" necessary to build and maintain the set of common resources needed to successfully implement and sustain an IPE program. They interpret these principles in the context of their own experiences implementing IPE programs and recommend three institutional structural elements necessary to build and sustain an IPE program: (1) a representative governance body, (2) an accountable director or leader, and (3) a structure supporting vertical and horizontal communication and authority.",,,"Earnest, MA|Pfeifle, AL","Earnest, Mark A.|Pfeifle, Andrea L.",754,-1,,,,,,,-1,,-1,,,,,,,,Editorial Material,10.1097/ACM.0000000000001183,,,,756,Clarivate Analytics Web of Science,,,,,,1040-2446,6,,,ACADEMIC MEDICINE,,,,,-1,,,,JUN,J,2016,,,,,,"Education, Scientific Disciplines|Health Care Sciences & Services",,-1,,Education & Educational Research; Health Care Sciences & Services,,1,Addressing the Irreducible Needs of Interprofessional Education: Creating and Sustaining an Institutional Commons for Health Professions Training,1,,WOS:000378041800010,1,91,1938-808X,27049542,C:\Users\mginda\Desktop\agc1\wos-extract.isi,"Earnest MA, 2016, V91, P754, DOI 10.1097/ACM.0000000000001183"
"Although approximately 60 to 70 percent of detained adolescents meet criteria for a mental disorder, few receive treatment upon community re-entry. Given that mental health treatment can reduce recidivism, we examined detained adolescents' mental health needs and their postdetention mental health treatment and recidivism. Altogether, 1,574 adolescents (<= 18 years) completed a mental health screening at a detention center. Scores on the screening, mental health treatment utilization (60 days after detention), and recidivism. (6 months after detention) were measured. About 82.2 percent of adolescents had elevated scores on the mental health screening, but only 16.4 percent obtained treatment and 37.2 percent reoffended. Logistic regression models revealed adolescents with insurance and higher angry irritable scores were significantly more likely to obtain treatment, whereas males, black and older adolescents, and those endorsing a trauma history were less likely. Black adolescents, insured adolescents, and those with higher alcohol and drug use scores were significantly more likely to reoffend. Mental health treatment increased the likelihood of recidivism. The prevalence of mental health needs among detained adolescents was high, but treatment utilization was low, with notable treatment disparities across race, gender, and age. The use of mental health treatment predicted recidivism, suggesting that treatment acts as a proxy measure of mental health problems. Future research should assess the impact of timely and continuous mental health services on recidivism among detained adolescents.",,,"Aalsma, MC|Lau, KSL|White, LM","Aalsma, Matthew C.|Lau, Katherine S.

"Pelvic and retroperitoneal trauma is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in multiply injured patients. The Injury Severity Score (ISS) has been criticized for underrepresenting and inaccurately defining mechanical injury. The influence of pelvic injury volume on organ dysfunction and multiple organ failure (MOF) has not been described. Through the use of CT, this investigation sought to precisely define volumes of mechanical tissue damage by anatomic region and examine its impact on organ failure. (1) Do patients with MOF have a greater volume of pelvic and retroperitoneal tissue damage when compared with those without MOF? (2) In patients who sustained pelvic trauma, does the magnitude of pelvic injury differ in patients with MOF? (3) Does the magnitude of organ dysfunction correlate with pelvic tissue damage volume? Seventy-four multiply injured patients aged 18 to 65 years with an ISS a parts per thousand yen 18 admitted to the intensive care unit for a minimum of 6 days with complete admission CT scans were analyzed. Each identifiable injury in the head/neck, chest, abdomen, and pelvis underwent volumetric determination using CT to generate regional tissue damage volume scores. Primary outcomes were the development of MOF as measured by the Denver MOF score and the degree of organ dysfunction by utilization of the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score. Mean pelvic and retroperitoneal tissue damage volumes were compared in patients who developed MOF and those who did not develop MOF using Student's t-test. Among patients who sustained pelvic injuries, we compared mean volume of tissue damaged in patients who developed MOF and those who did not. We assessed whether there was a correlation between organ dysfunction, as measured by the SOFA score as a continuous variable, and the volume of pelvic and retroperitoneal tissue damage using the Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient. The average volume of tissue damage was greater in patients with MOF when compared with those without (MOF: 685.667 +/- 1081.344; non-MOF: 195.511 +/- 381.436; mean difference 490.156 cc [95% confidence interval {CI}, 50.076-930.237 cc], p = 0.030). Among patients who sustained pelvic injuries, those with MOF had higher average tissue damage volumes than those without MOF (MOF: 1322.000 +/- 1197.050; non-MOF: 382.750 +/- 465.005; mean difference 939.250 [95% CI, 229.267-1649.233], p = 0.013). Organ dysfunction (SOFA score) correlated with higher volumes of pelvic tissue damage (r = 0.570, p < 0.001). This investigation demonstrated that greater degrees of pelvic and retroperitoneal tissue damage calculated from injury CT scans in multiply injured patients is associated with more severe organ dysfunction and an increased risk of developing MOF. Early identification of polytrauma patients at risk of MOF allows clinicians to implement appropriate resuscitative strategies early in the disease course. Improved stratification of injury severity and a patient's anticipated clinical course may aid in the planning and execution of staged orthopaedic interventions. Future avenues of study should incorporate the ischemic/hypoperfusion component of pelvic injury in conjunction with the mechanical component presented here for improved stratification of multiply injured patients at higher risk of MOF.

"Adherence to treatment is one of the most consistent factors associated with a favorable addiction treatment outcome. Little is known about factors associated with treatment adherence in individuals affected with comorbid attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and substance use disorders (SUD). This study aimed to explore whether treatment-associated factors, such as the prescribing physician's (sub)specialty and methylphenidate (MPH) dose, or patient-related factors, such as sex, age, SUD subtype, and psychiatric comorbidity, were associated with adherence to MPH treatment. Swedish national registers were used to identify adult individuals with prescriptions of MPH and medications specifically used in the treatment of SUD or a diagnosis of SUD and/or coexisting psychiatric diagnoses. Primary outcome measure was days in active MPH treatment in stratified dose groups (<= 36 mg, >= 37 mg to <= 54 mg, >= 55 mg to <= 72 mg, >= 73 mg to <= 90 mg, >= 91 mg to <= 108 mg, and >= 109 mg). Lower MPH doses (ie, <= 36 mg day 100) were associated with treatment discontinuation between days 101 and 830 (HR <= 36 mg, 1.67; HR37-54mg, 1.37; HR55-72mg, 1.36; HR73-90mg, 1.19; HR >= 108mg, 1.09). The results showed a linear trend (P < 0.0001) toward decreased risk of treatment discontinuation along with increase of MPH doses. In conclusion, this study shows that higher MPH doses were associated with long-term treatment adherence in individuals with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and SUD.",,,"Almqvist, C|Brandt, L|D'Onofrio, BM|Franck, J|Konstenius, M|Larsson, H|Skoglund, C","Almqvist, Catarina|Brandt, Lena|D'Onofrio, Brian M.|Franck, Johan|Konstenius, Maija|Larsson, Henrik|Skoglund, Charlotte",222,-1,,,,,,,-1,,-1,,,,,,,,Article,10.1097/JCP.0000000000000501,,,,228,Clarivate Analytics Web of Science,,,,,,0271-0749,3,,,JOURNAL OF CLINICAL PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY,,,,DEFICIT HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER|PLACEBO-CONTROLLED TRIAL|EXTENDED-RELEASE METHYLPHENIDATE|DRUG-ABUSE TREATMENT|DEPENDENT SUBJECTS|CLINICAL-TRIAL|ADHD|COCAINE|DISCONTINUATION|METAANALYSIS,-1,,MPH dose|treatment adherence|substance use disorders,,JUN,J,2016,,,,,,Pharmacology & Pharmacy|Psychiatry,,-1,,Pharmacology & Pharmacy; Psychiatry,,3,Factors Associated With Adherence to Methylphenidate Treatment in Adult Patients With Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder and Substance Use Disorders,3,,WOS:000375089900006,1,36,1533-712X,27043119,C:\Users\mginda\Desktop\agc1\wos-extract.isi,"Skoglund C, 2016, V36, P222, DOI 10.1097/JCP.0000000000000501"

"Neighborhood influences in the etiology of schizophrenia have been emphasized in a number of systematic reviews, but causality remains uncertain. To test the social drift hypothesis, we used three complementary genetically informed Swedish cohorts. First, we used nationwide Swedish data on approximately 760 000 full-and half-sibling pairs born between 1951 and 1974 and quantitative genetic models to study genetic and environmental influences on the overlap between schizophrenia in young adulthood and subsequent residence in socioeconomically deprived neighborhoods. Schizophrenia diagnoses were ascertained using the National Patient Registry. Second, we tested the overlap between childhood psychotic experiences and neighborhood deprivation in early adulthood in the longitudinal Twin Study of Child and Adolescent Development (TCHAD; n = 2960). Third, we investigated to what extent polygenic risk scores for schizophrenia predicted residence in deprived neighborhoods during late adulthood using the TwinGene sample (n = 6796). Sibling data suggested that living in deprived neighborhoods was substantially heritable; 65% (95% confidence interval (95% CI): 60-71%) of the variance was attributed to genetic influences. Although the correlation between schizophrenia and neighborhood deprivation was moderate in magnitude (r = 0.22; 95% CI: 0.20-0.24), it was entirely explained by genetic influences. We replicated these findings in the TCHAD sample. Moreover, the association between polygenic risk for schizophrenia and neighborhood deprivation was statistically significant (R-2 = 0.15%, P = 0.002). Our findings are primarily consistent with a genetic selection interpretation where genetic liability for schizophrenia also predicts subsequent residence in socioeconomically deprived neighborhoods. Previous studies may have overemphasized the relative importance of environmental influences in the social drift of schizophrenia patients. Clinical and policy interventions will therefore benefit from the future identification of potentially causal pathways between different dimensions of cognitive functions and socioeconomic trajectories derived from studies adopting family-based research designs.",,"Bergen, Sarah/I-8313-2012","Bergen, SE|D'Onofrio, BM|Fazel, S|Kuja-Halkola, R|Langstorm, N|Larsson, H|Lichtenstein, P|Sariaslan, A","Bergen, S.E.|D'Onofrio, Brian M.|Fazel, Seena|Kuja-Halkola, Ralf|Langstorm, Niklas|Larsson, Henrik|Lichtenstein, Paul|Sariaslan, Amir",,-1,,,,,,,-1,,-1,,,,,,,,Article,10.1038/tp.2016.62,,,,,Clarivate Analytics Web of Science,,,,,,2158-3188,,,,TRANSLATIONAL PSYCHIATRY,,,e796,ADOLESCENT VIOLENT CRIMINALITY|ENVIRONMENT INTERACTION|SUBSTANCE MISUSE|SWEDISH TWIN|EMPLOYMENT|PSYCHOSIS|SYMPTOMS|ASSOCIATION|EXPERIENCES|PREDICTORS,-1,"Langstrom, Niklas/0000-0002-2686-6799; Bergen, Sarah/0000-0002-5888-0034; Kuja-Halkola, Ralf/0000-0002-3765-2067",,,3-May,J,2016,,,,,,Psychiatry,,-1,,Psychiatry,,17,"Schizophrenia and subsequent neighborhood deprivation: revisiting the social drift hypothesis using population, twin and molecular genetic data",17,,WOS:000377305600002,1,6,,27138795,C:\Users\mginda\Desktop\agc1\wos-extract.isi,"Sariaslan A, 2016, V6, DOI 10.1038/tp.2016.62"
"Prominent developmental theories posit a causal link between early-life exposures and later functioning. Yet, observed associations with early exposures may not reflect causal effects because of genetic and environmental confounding. The current manuscript describes how a systematic series of epidemiologic analyses that combine several genetically-informative designs and statistical approaches can help distinguish between competing theories. In particular, the manuscript details how combining the use of measured covariates with sibling-comparisons, cousin-comparisons, and additional designs can help elucidate the sources of covariation between early-life exposures and later outcomes, including the roles of (a) factors that are not shared in families, including a potential causal effect of the exposure; (b) carryover effects from the exposure of one child to the next; and (c) familial confounding. We also describe key assumptions and how they can be critically evaluated. Furthermore, we outline how subsequent analyses, including effect decomposition with respect to measured, plausible mediators, and quantitative genetic models can help further specify the underlying processes that account for the associations between early-life exposures and offspring outcomes.",,,"Almqvist, C|Class, QA|D'Onofrio, BM|Kuja-Halkola, R|Larsson, H|Lichtenstein, P|Oberg, AS|Rickert, ME|Sjolander, A|Sujan, AC","Almqvist, Catarina|Class, Quetzal A.|D'Onofrio, Brian M.|Kuja-Halkola, Ralf|Larsson, Henrik|Lichtenstein, Paul|Oberg, Anna S.|Rickert, Martin|Sjolander, Arvid|Sujan, Ayesha C.",315,-1,,,,,,,-1,,-1,,,,,,,,Review,10.1007/s10519-015-9769-8,,,,328,Clarivate Analytics Web of Science,,,,,,0001-8244,3,,,BEHAVIOR GENETICS,,,,TEST CAUSAL HYPOTHESES|ANIMAL-MODELS|NEUROPSYCHIATRIC DISORDERS|ENVIRONMENTAL CONFOUNDS|NONSHARED ENVIRONMENT|DEVELOPMENTAL ORIGINS|GENETIC INFLUENCES|SENSITIVE PERIODS|ADVERSE OUTCOMES|MATERNAL SMOKING,-1,"Oberg, Anna/0000-0001-6638-1895; Kuja-Halkola, Ralf/0000-0002-3765-2067; D'Onofrio, Brian/0000-0002-5248-7434",Causal inference|Genetically-informed designs|Sibling comparisons|Cousin comparisons|Developmental origins of health and disease|Pregnancy|Fetal growth,,MAY,J,2016,,,,,,"Behavioral Sciences|Genetics & Heredity|Psychology, Multidisciplinary",,-1,SI,Behavioral Sciences; Genetics & Heredity; Psychology,,11,Translational Epidemiologic Approaches to Understanding the Consequences of Early-Life Exposures,11,,WOS:000375616400004,1,46,1573-3297,26590988,C:\Users\mginda\Desktop\agc1\wos-extract.isi,"D'Onofrio BM, 2016, V46, P315, DOI 10.1007/s10519-015-9769-8"

We also conducted sensitivity analyses to test limitations of the designs. The findings were consistent across samples and suggested that, associations observed in the population between younger MAC and shorter gestational age were confounded by shared familial factors; however, associations of advanced MAC with shorter gestational age remained robust after accounting for shared familial factors. In contrast to the gestational age findings, neither early nor advanced MAC was associated with lower fetal growth after accounting for shared familial factors.

"Purpose Behavioral and social science (BSS) competencies are needed to provide quality health care, but psychometrically validated measures to assess these competencies are difficult to find. Moreover, they have not been mapped to existing frameworks, like those from the Liaison Committee on Medical Education (LCME) and Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME). This systematic review aimed to identify and evaluate the quality of assessment tools used to measure BSS competencies. Method The authors searched the literature published between January 2002 and March 2014 for articles reporting psychometric or other validity/reliability testing, using OVID, CINAHL, PubMed, ERIC, Research and Development Resource Base, SOCIOFILE, and PsycINFO. They reviewed 5,104 potentially relevant titles and abstracts. To guide their review, they mapped BSS competencies to existing LCME and ACGME frameworks. The final included articles fell into three categories: instrument development, which were of the highest quality; educational research, which were of the second highest quality; and curriculum evaluation, which were of lower quality. Results Of the 114 included articles, 33 (29%) yielded strong evidence supporting tools to assess communication skills, cultural competence, empathy/compassion, behavioral health counseling, professionalism, and teamwork. Sixty-two (54%) articles yielded moderate evidence and 19 (17%) weak evidence. Articles mapped to all LCME standards and ACGME core competencies; the most common was communication skills. Conclusions These findings serve as a valuable resource for medical educators and researchers. More rigorous measurement validation and testing and more robust study designs are needed to understand how educational strategies contribute to BSS competency development.",,,"Biagioli, FE|Carney, PA|Estroff, SE|Hatt, WJ|Lambros, A|Litzelman, DK|Miller, MF|Palmer, RT|Satterfield, JM|Teal, CR|Thayer, EK","Biagioli, Frances E.|Carney, Patricia A.|Estroff, Sue E.|Hatt, William J.|Lambros, Ann|Litzelman, Debra K.|Miller, Marissa Fuqua|Palmer, Ryan T.|Satterfield, Jason M.|Teal, Cayla R.|Thayer, Erin K.",730,-1,,,,,,,-1,,-1,,,,,,,,Review,10.1097/ACM.0000000000001090,,,,742,Clarivate Analytics Web of Science,,,,,,1040-2446,5,,,ACADEMIC MEDICINE,,,,STUDENTS COMMUNICATION-SKILLS|RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED-TRIAL|STANDARDIZED-PATIENT EXAMINATION|MOTIVATIONAL INTERVIEWING CURRICULUM|SURGERY RESIDENCY PROGRAM|STRUCTURED VIDEO EXAM|HABITS CODING SCHEME|CLINICAL COMMUNICATION|COUNSELING SKILLS|PHYSICIAN EMPATHY,-1,,,,MAY,J,2016,,,,,,"Education, Scientific Disciplines|Health Care Sciences & Services",,-1,,Education & Educational Research; Health Care Sciences & Services,,6,Tools to Assess Behavioral and Social Science Competencies in Medical Education: A Systematic Review,6,,WOS:000375153500034,1,91,1938-808X,26796091,C:\Users\mginda\Desktop\agc1\wos-extract.isi,"Carney PA, 2016, V91, P730, DOI 10.1097/ACM.0000000000001090"
"Purpose: Violence-related injuries are a major cause of death and disability among adolescents in the United States. The objective of this study was to examine trends in adolescent violence-related injuries between 2009 and 2013. Methods: This study examined data from the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System-All Injury Program for years 2009-2013. Linear regression was used to assess trends in rates of violence-related injuries among adolescents aged between 10 and 19 years. Results: We found overall rates of nonfatal violence-related injuries among all adolescents did not change significantly across the study years (p = .502). However, self-harm injury rates have significantly increased among female and younger adolescents during the period (p = .001 and .011, respectively). Conclusions: Our results indicate that the overall intentional injury rates in adolescents have been stable; however, rates of self-injury have significantly increased in younger adolescents and females. Future research should focus on exploring causes of increases in self-harm injuries in these subpopulations. (C) 2016 Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine.

Materials and methods: A prospective, observational cohort of 500 adults with an Injury Severity Score > 10 but without traumatic brain or spinal cord injury from 2009 to 2011 was formed. The Short Form-36 was administered at admission and repeated at 1, 2, 4, and 12 mo after injury. Group-based trajectory modeling was used to determine the number and shape of physical composite score (PCS) and mental composite score (MCS) trajectories. Results: Three PCS trajectories and five MCS trajectories were identified. For PCS, trajectory 1 (10.4%) has low baseline scores, followed by no improvement over time. Trajectory 2 (65.6%) declines 1 mo after injury then improves over time. Trajectory 3 (24.1%) has a sharp decline followed by rapid recovery. For MCS, trajectory 1 (9.4%) is low at baseline and remains low. Trajectory 2 (14.4%) has a large decrease after injury and does not recover over the next 12 mo. Trajectory 3 (22.7%) has an initial decrease in MCS early, followed by continuous recovery. Trajectory 4 (19.1%) has a steady decline over the study period. Trajectory 5 (34.3%) stays consistently high at all time points. Conclusions: Recovery after injury is complex and results in multiple recovery trajectories. This has implications for patient-centered clinical trial design and in development of patient-specific interventions to improve outcomes. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

"Background: Multiply injured patients (MIPs) are at risk to develop multiple-organ failure (MOF) and prolonged systemic inflammation response syndrome (SIRS). It is difficult to predict which MIPs are at the highest risk to develop these complications. We have developed a novel method that quantifies the distribution and physical magnitude of all injuries identified on admission computed tomography scanning called the Tissue Damage Volume (TDV) score. We explored how individualized TDV scores corresponded to MOF and SIRS. Materials and methods: A retrospective study on 74 MIPs measured mechanical TDV by calculating injury volumes on admission computed tomography scans of all injuries in the head/neck, chest, abdomen, and pelvis. Regional and total TDV scores were compared between patients that did or did not develop MOF or sustained SIRS. The magnitude of organ dysfunction was also stratified by the magnitude of TDV. Results: Mean total and pelvic TDV scores were significantly increased in patients who developed MOF. Mean total, chest, and abdominal TDV scores were increased in patients who developed sustained SIRS. The magnitude of organ dysfunction was significantly higher in patients who sustained large volume injuries in the pelvis or abdomen, and in patients who sustained injuries in at least three anatomic regions. Conclusions: A novel index that quantifies the magnitude and distribution of mechanical tissue damage volume is a patient-specific index that can be used to identify patients who have sustained injury patterns that predict progression to MOF and SIRS. The preliminary methods will need refinement and prospective validation. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

"Objective: This study investigated responsibilities, skill sets, degrees, and certifications required of health care navigators in order to identify areas of potential overlap with health sciences librarianship. Method: The authors conducted a content analysis of health care navigator position announcements and developed and assigned forty-eight category terms to represent the sample's responsibilities and skill sets. Results: Coordination of patient care and a bachelor's degree were the most common responsibility and degree requirements, respectively. Results also suggest that managing and providing health information resources is an area of overlap between health care navigators and health sciences librarians, and that librarians are well suited to serve on navigation teams. Conclusion: Such overlap may provide an avenue for collaboration between navigators and health sciences librarians.",,,"Huber, JT|Nix, AT|Pfeifle, AL|Shapiro, RM","Huber, Jeffrey T.|Nix, A.

"Background Given the frequency with which families change residences, the effects of childhood relocations have gained increasing research attention. Many researchers have demonstrated that childhood relocations are associated with a variety of adverse outcomes. However, drawing strong causal claims remains problematic due to uncontrolled confounding factors. Method We utilized longitudinal, population-based Swedish registers to generate a nationally representative sample of offspring born 1983-1997 (n = 1 510 463). Using Cox regression and logistic regression, we examined the risk for numerous adverse outcomes after childhood relocation while controlling for measured covariates. To account for unmeasured genetic and environmental confounds, we also compared differentially exposed cousins and siblings. Results In the cohort baseline model, each annual relocation was associated with risk for the adverse outcomes, including suicide attempt [hazard ratio (HR) 1.19, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.19-1.20]. However, when accounting for offspring and parental covariates (HR 1.08, 95% CI 1.07-1.09), as well as genetic and environmental confounds shared by cousins (HR 1.07, 95% CI 1.05-1.09) and siblings (HR 1.00, 95% CI 0.97-1.04), the risk for suicide attempt attenuated. We found a commensurate pattern of results for severe mental illness, substance abuse, criminal convictions, and low academic achievement. Conclusions Previous research may have overemphasized the independent association between relocations and later adverse outcomes. The results suggest that the association between childhood relocations and suicide attempt, psychiatric problems, and low academic achievement is partially explained by genetic and environmental confounds correlated with relocations. This study demonstrates the importance of using family-based, quasi-experimental designs to test plausible alternate hypotheses when examining causality.",,,"Almqvist, C|Bramson, LM|Class, QA|D'Onofrio, BM|Larsson, H|Lichtenstein, P|Rickert, ME|Sariaslan, A","Almqvist, Catarina|Bramson, L.

"Recent advances in the adoption and use of health information technology (HIT) have had a dramatic impact on the practice of medicine. In many environments, this has led to the ability to achieve new efficiencies and levels of safety. In others, the impact has been less positive, and is associated with both: 1) workflow and user experience dissatisfaction; and 2) perceptions of missed opportunities relative to the use of computational tools to enable data-driven and precise clinical decision making. Simultaneously, the ""pipeline"" through which new diagnostic tools and therapeutic agents are being developed and brought to the point-of-care or population health is challenged in terms of both cost and timeliness. Given the confluence of these trends, it can be argued that now is the time to consider new ways in which HIT can be used to deliver health and wellness interventions comparable to traditional approaches (e.g., drugs, devices, diagnostics, and behavioral modifications). Doing so could serve to fulfill the promise of what has been recently promoted as ""precision medicine"" in a rapid and cost-effective manner. However, it will also require the health and life sciences community to embrace new modes of using HIT, wherein the use of technology becomes a primary intervention as opposed to enabler of more conventional approaches, a model that we refer to in this commentary as ""interventional informatics"". Such a paradigm requires attention to critical issues, including: 1) the nature of the relationships between HIT vendors and healthcare innovators; 2) the formation and function of multidisciplinary teams consisting of technologists, informaticians, and clinical or scientific subject matter experts; and 3) the optimal design and execution of clinical studies that focus on HIT as the intervention of interest. Ultimately, the goal of an ""interventional informatics"" approach can and should be to substantially improve human health and wellness through the use of data-driven interventions at the point of care of broader population levels. Achieving a vision of ""interventional informatics"" will requires us to re-think how we study HIT tools in order to generate the necessary evidence-base that can support and justify their use as a primary means of improving the human condition.",,"Embi, Peter/E-3030-2011; Lussier, Yves/N-4891-2017","Embi, PJ|Foraker, RE|Lussier, Y|Payne, PRO","Embi, Peter J.|Foraker, Randi E.|Lussier, Yves|Payne, Philip R.

"Background: The development of effective health care and public health interventions requires a comprehensive understanding of the perceptions, concerns, and stated needs of health care consumers and the public at large. Big datasets from social media and question-and-answer services provide insight into the public's health concerns and priorities without the financial, temporal, and spatial encumbrances of more traditional community-engagement methods and may prove a useful starting point for public-engagement health research (infodemiology). Objective: The objective of our study was to describe user characteristics and health-related queries of the ChaCha question-and-answer platform, and discuss how these data may be used to better understand the perceptions, concerns, and stated needs of health care consumers and the public at large. Methods: We conducted a retrospective automated textual analysis of anonymous user-generated queries submitted to ChaCha between January 2009 and November 2012. A total of 2.004 billion queries were read, of which 3.50% (70,083,796/2,004,243,249) were missing 1 or more data fields, leaving 1.934 billion complete lines of data for these analyses. Results: Males and females submitted roughly equal numbers of health queries, but content differed by sex. Questions from females predominantly focused on pregnancy, menstruation, and vaginal health. Questions from males predominantly focused on body image, drug use, and sexuality. Adolescents aged 12-19 years submitted more queries than any other age group. Their queries were largely centered on sexual and reproductive health, and pregnancy in particular. Conclusions: The private nature of the ChaCha service provided a perfect environment for maximum frankness among users, especially among adolescents posing sensitive health questions. Adolescents' sexual health queries reveal knowledge gaps with serious, lifelong consequences. The nature of questions to the service provides opportunities for rapid understanding of health concerns and may lead to development of more effective tailored interventions.",,"Wiehe, Sarah/R-6083-2017","Carpenter, JS|Furrey, C|Groves, D|Knopf, A|Krishnan, A|Miller, WR|Otte, JL|Palakal, M|Priest, C|Wiehe, SE|Wilson, JS","Carpenter, Janet S.|Furrey, Christopher|Groves, Doyle|Knopf, Amelia|Krishnan, Anand|Miller, Wendy R.|Otte, Julie L.|Palakal, Mathew|Priest, Chad|Wiehe, Sarah E.|Wilson, Jeffery S.",,-1,,,,,,,-1,,-1,,,,,,,,Article,10.2196/jmir.5033,,,,,Clarivate Analytics Web of Science,,,,,,1438-8871,3,,,JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH,,,e44,INTERNET,-1,"Wiehe, Sarah/0000-0002-8148-0848; Otte, Julie/0000-0002-6408-1466; Groves, Doyle/0000-0003-2986-9407; Carpenter, Janet/0000-0003-3988-8855; Miller, Wendy/0000-0003-1779-7290; Priest, Chad/0000-0002-4701-3402",social meda|health information seeking|adolescent|sexual health|patient engagement|ChaCha|big data|question-and-answer service|infodemiology|infoveillance,,MAR,J,2016,,,,,,Health Care Sciences & Services|Medical Informatics,,-1,,Health Care Sciences & Services; Medical Informatics,,8,Finding the Patient's Voice Using Big Data: Analysis of Users' Health-Related Concerns in the ChaCha Question-and-Answer Service (2009-2012),9,,WOS:000380777500001,1,18,,26960745,C:\Users\mginda\Desktop\agc1\wos-extract.isi,"Priest C, 2016, V18, DOI 10.2196/jmir.5033"

"We investigated the implementation feasibility and effectiveness of community-based HIV home-test voucher distribution in three Indianapolis African American communities. Community-based organizations augmented traditional outreach methods to distribute vouchers for home HIV tests redeemable at three pharmacies during three distribution waves from February to April 30, 2015. Voucher redemption served as a proxy indicator of intent to test for HIV. 315 vouchers were distributed and 47 vouchers were redeemed for a 14.9% redemption rate. Distribution was 46% of plan. Vouchers were redeemed at all three pharmacies, and 21% of visits involved redemption of more than one voucher. The original team of seven distributors in three organizations reduced to a remaining five distributors in two organizations by wave 2.

"Objective: To explore relationships between local health department policy behaviors, levels of government activity, policy focus areas, and selected health department characteristics. Design: Cross-sectional analysis of secondary data from the 2013 National Association of County & City Health Officials (NACCHO) Profile Survey. Setting: Local health departments throughout the United States. Participants: A total of 2000 local health departments responding to the 2013 Profile Survey of Local Health Departments. Survey data were gathered by the NACCHO. Methods: Secondary analysis of reported policy behaviors for the 2013 NACCHO Profile Survey. A structural equation model tested effects on and between state population size, rurality, census region and policy focus, and the latent variables of policy behavior formed from a confirmatory factor analysis. Main Outcome Measures: Policy behaviors, levels of government activity (local, state, and federal), policy focus areas, and selected local health department characteristics. Results: The majority (85.1%) of health departments reported at least one of the possible policy behaviors. State population size increased the probability of local policy behavior, and local behavior increased the probability of state policy behavior. State size increased the likelihood of federal policy behavior and the focus on tobacco, emergency preparedness, and obesity/chronic disease. However, the more rural a state was, the more likely policy behavior was at the state and federal levels and not at local levels. Specific policy behaviors mattered less than the level of government activity.

"IMPORTANCE Suicide attempts are common in individuals with eating disorders. More precise understanding of the mechanisms underlying their concomitant occurrence is needed. OBJECTIVE To examine the association between eating disorders and suicide attempts and whether familial risk factors contribute to the association. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A Swedish birth cohort including individuals born in Sweden between January 1, 1979, and December 31, 2001, was followed up from age 6 years to December 31, 2009 (N = 2 268 786). Information was acquired from Swedish national registers. All individuals were linked to their biological full siblings, maternal half siblings, paternal half siblings, full cousins, and half cousins. Data analysis was conducted from October 5, 2014, to April 28, 2015. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Eating disorders were captured by 3 variables (any eating disorder, anorexia nervosa, and bulimia nervosa) identified by any lifetime diagnoses recorded in the registers. Suicide attempts were defined as any suicide attempts, including death by suicide, recorded in the registers. We examined the association between eating disorders and death by suicide separately, but the study was underpowered to explore familial liability for this association. RESULTS Of 2 268 786 individuals, 15 457 females (1.40% of all females) and 991 males (0.09% of all males) had any eating disorder, 7680 females (0.70%) and 453 males (0.04%) had anorexia nervosa, and 3349 females (0.30%), and 61 males (0.01%) had bulimia nervosa. Individuals with any eating disorder had an increased risk (reported as odds ratio [95% CI]) of suicide attempts (5.28 [5.04-5.54]) and death by suicide (5.39 [4.00-7.25]). The risks were attenuated but remained significant after adjusting for comorbid major depressive disorder, anxiety disorder, and substance use disorder (suicide attempts: 1.82 [1.72-1.93]; death by suicide: 2.04 [1.49-2.80]). Similar results were found for anorexia nervosa (suicide attempts: crude, 4.42 [4.12-4.74] vs adjusted, 1.70 [1.56-1.85]; death by suicide: crude, 6.46 [4.38-9.54] vs adjusted, 2.67 [1.78-4.01]) and bulimia nervosa (suicide attempts: crude, 6.26 [5.73-6.85] vs adjusted, 1.88 [1.68-2.10]; death by suicide: crude, 4.45 [2.44-8.11] vs adjusted, 1.48 [0.81-2.72]). Individuals (index) who had a full sibling with any eating disorder had an increased risk of suicide attempts (1.41 [1.29-1.53]). The risk was attenuated for any eating disorder in more-distant relatives (maternal half siblings, 1.10 [0.90-1.34]; paternal half siblings, 1.21 [0.98-1.49]; full cousins, 1.11 [1.06-1.18]; half cousins, 0.90 [0.78-1.03]). This familial pattern remained stable after adjusting for the index individuals' eating disorders. Similar patterns were found for anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE These results suggest an increased risk of suicide attempts in individuals with lifetime eating disorders and their relatives. The pattern of familial coaggregation suggests familial liability for the association between eating disorders and suicide. Psychiatric comorbidities partially explain this association, suggesting particularly high-risk presentations.",,,"Almqvist, C|Bulik, CM|D'Onofrio, BM|Kuja-Halkola, R|Larsson, H|Lichtenstein, P|Runfola, CD|Sjolander, A|Thornton, LM|Yao, SY","Almqvist, Catarina|Bulik, Cynthia M.|D'Onofrio, Brian M.|Kuja-Halkola, Ralf|Larsson, Henrik|Lichtenstein, Paul|Runfola, Cristin D.|Sjolander, Arvid|Thornton, Laura M.|Yao, Shuyang",284,-1,,,,,,,-1,,-1,,,,,,,,Article,10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2015.2737,,,,291,Clarivate Analytics Web of Science,,,,,,2168-622X,3,,,JAMA PSYCHIATRY,,,,NATIONAL COMORBIDITY SURVEY|NESTED CASE-CONTROL|ANOREXIA-NERVOSA|RISK-FACTORS|MORTALITY-RATES|PREVALENCE|METAANALYSIS|BEHAVIOR|TWIN,-1,"Kuja-Halkola, Ralf/0000-0002-3765-2067",,,MAR,J,2016,,,,,,Psychiatry,,-1,,Psychiatry,,16,Familial Liability for Eating Disorders and Suicide Attempts Evidence From a Population Registry in Sweden,17,,WOS:000371613500016,1,73,2168-6238,26764185,C:\Users\mginda\Desktop\agc1\wos-extract.isi,"Yao SY, 2016, V73, P284, DOI 10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2015.2737"
"Introduction: Black male youth are at high risk of homicide and criminal justice involvement. This study aimed to determine how early mortality among youth offenders varies based on race; gender; and the continuum of justice system involvement: arrest, detention, incarceration, and transfer to adult courts. Methods: Criminal and death records of 49,479 youth offenders (ages 10-18 years at first arrest) in Marion County, Indiana, from January 1, 1999, to December 31, 2011, were examined. Statistical analyses were completed in November 2014. Results: From 1999 to 2011 (aggregate exposure, 386,709 person-years), 518 youth offender deaths occurred. The most common cause of death was homicide (48.2%). The mortality rate of youth offenders was nearly 1.5 times greater than that among community youth (standardized mortality ratio, 1.48). The youth offender mortality rate varied depending on the severity of justice system involvement. Arrested youth had the lowest rate of mortality (90/100,000), followed by detained youth (165/100,000); incarcerated youth (216/100,000); and youth transferred to adult court (313/100,000). A proportional hazards model demonstrated that older age, male gender, and more severe justice system involvement 5 years post-arrest predicted shorter time to mortality. Conclusions: Youth offenders face greater risk for early death than community youth. Among these, black male youth face higher risk of early mortality than their white male counterparts. However, regardless of race/ethnicity, mortality rates for youth offenders increase as youth involvement in the justice system becomes more protracted and severe. Thus, justice system involvement is a significant factor to target for intervention.

"The identification and exploration of moderators of health department accreditation remain limited by current dichotomous conceptualizations of pursuit. Methods: A 2015 survey measured Indiana local health department (LHD) accreditation pursuit and progress, classifying respondents by progress evidence. Covariates included attitudes about the future impact of accreditation on funding and performance, health department size, geography, health outcome ranking, and quality improvement (QI) programing. Results: Four classifications of accreditation pursuit emerged and were found to have greater association with covariates than standard dichotomous measures. ""Active Pursuit"" was associated with formal QI programing and a belief that accreditation will impact future funding and performance. ""Intent Only"" was associated with no QI programing and no completion of accreditation prerequisites. ""Discontinued"" was associated with the belief that accreditation will not impact future performance. ""Not Pursuing"" was associated with no interest or plan to complete prerequisites and reported belief that accreditation will not impact future health department funding or performance. Conclusion: More granular characterizations of accreditation pursuit may improve understanding of influential factors. This measurement framework should be validated in studies of LHDs in other states.",,,"Comer, KF|King, J|Liu, SS|Meyerson, BE|Miller, L","Comer, Karen Frederickson|King, Jerry|Liu, Sandra S.|Meyerson, Beth E.|Miller, Laura",,-1,,,,,,,-1,,-1,,,,,,,,Article,10.3389/fpubh.2016.00021,,,,,Clarivate Analytics Web of Science,,,,,,2296-2565,,,,FRONTIERS IN PUBLIC HEALTH,,,UNSP 21,PUBLIC-HEALTH|BARRIERS,-1,,local health departments|public health accreditation|performance improvement|public health organizational development|public health administration,,16-Feb,J,2016,,,,,,"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health",,-1,,"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health",,3,It's Not Just a Yes or No Answer: Expressions of Local Health Department Accreditation,3,,WOS:000408194000001,1,4,,26909344,C:\Users\mginda\Desktop\agc1\wos-extract.isi,"Meyerson BE, 2016, V4, DOI 10.3389/fpubh.2016.00021"
"Binge ethanol consumption has widespread negative consequences for global public health. Rodent models offer exceptional power to explore the neurobiology underlying and affected by binge-like drinking as well as target potential prevention, intervention, and treatment strategies. An important characteristic of these models is their ability to consistently produce pharmacologically-relevant blood ethanol concentration. This review examines the current available rodent models of voluntary, pre-dependent binge-like ethanol consumption and their utility in various research strategies. Studies have demonstrated that a diverse array of neurotransmitters regulate binge-like drinking, resembling some findings from other drinking models. Furthermore, repeated binge-like drinking recruits neuroadaptive mechanisms in mesolimbocortical reward circuitry. New opportunities that these models offer in the current context of mechanistic research are also discussed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

"Background: Depression around the time of pregnancy affects at least 1 in 8 women and treatment with selective serotonin re- uptake inhibitors (SSRIs) in pregnant women has been increasing, but research on adverse effects on the fetus have so far commonly used designs unable to account for confounding. We aimed to examine the effects of prenatal SSRI exposure on offspring size outcomes and gestational age, and disentangle whether associations observed were due to the medication or other factors. Methods: We used a Swedish population-based cohort of 392 029 children and national registers to estimate the associations between prenatal exposure to SSRIs and depression on the outcomes birthweight, birth length, birth head circumference, gestational age at birth and preterm birth. A sub-sample of 1007 children was analysed in a within-family design that accounts for unmeasured parental genetic and environmental confounders. Results: Crude analyses revealed associations between prenatal SSRI exposure, and offspring birth size and gestational age. However, in the within-family analyses, only the association between SSRI exposure and reduced gestational age (-2.3 days; 95% confidence interval -3.8 to -0.8) was observed. Conclusions: This study indicates that prenatal SSRI exposure may not be causally related to offspring birth size. Rather, our analyses suggest that the association could be caused by other underlying differences instead of the medication per se. A small reduction of gestational age was associated with SSRI exposure in the within-family analysis and could be due to either the exposure, or other factors changing between pregnancies.",,"Magnusson, Patrik/C-4458-2017","Almqvist, C|D'Onofrio, BM|Landen, M|Larsson, H|Lichtenstein, P|Lundholm, C|Magnusson, PKE|Viktorin, A","Almqvist, Catarina|D'Onofrio, Brian M.|Landen, Mikael|Larsson, Henrik|Lichtenstein, Paul|Lundholm, Cecilia|Magnusson, Patrik K.

"BackgroundBinge alcohol (ethanol [EtOH]) drinking is common during adolescence, a time characterized by many behavioral and neurobiological changes. Among them, the GABA(A) receptor system undergoes substantial modifications, including changes in the density, distribution, and subunit composition of the receptor. Based on its demonstrated role in EtOH consumption, this study aimed to investigate the effects of 2 different GABA(A) receptor agonists on binge-like EtOH intake in adolescent and adult mice using the Drinking-in-the-Dark model. MethodsThree hours into their dark cycle, adolescent (postnatal day 28 [P28]) and adult (P63) male C57BL/6J mice were given daily access to 20% EtOH for 2hours during 8 consecutive days. Immediately before the access on day 8, mice (P35 and P70) were systemically injected with 1 of 2 different GABAergic drugs. The effects of muscimol, a full GABA(A) agonist, were assessed in a first experiment. The second experiment tested for the more specific involvement of -containing extrasynaptic GABA(A) receptors through the administration of THIP (4,5,6,7-tetrahydroisoxazolo(5,4-c)pyridin-3-ol). ResultsAdolescent mice consumed more EtOH than their adult counterparts. Following the administration of GABA(A) agonists, levels of EtOH intake were reduced at both ages. However, age-dependent differences were revealed following the administration of THIP, with adolescents exhibiting greater sensitivity to its suppressant effects, especially during the first 30minutes of binge EtOH access. ConclusionsThis study adds to the existing literature demonstrating the crucial role of the GABA(A) receptor in alcohol consumption. In addition, it suggests that age differences in the GABA(A) receptor modulation of binge alcohol drinking might be more dependent on extrasynaptic GABA(A) receptors.",,,"Boehm, SL|Quoilin, C","Boehm, Stephen L., II|Quoilin, Caroline",408,-1,,,,,,,-1,,-1,,,,,,,,Article,10.1111/acer.12953,,,,417,Clarivate Analytics Web of Science,,,,,,0145-6008,2,,,ALCOHOLISM-CLINICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL RESEARCH,,,,C57BL/6J MICE|NUCLEUS-ACCUMBENS|ADULT C57BL/6J|DBA/2J MICE|BEHAVIORAL-RESPONSES|ADOLESCENT C57BL/6J|LABORATORY RATS|ALCOHOL INTAKE|DENTATE GYRUS|ANXIETY-LIKE,-1,,Adolescence|GABA(A) Receptor|Muscimol|THIP|Binge Drinking,,FEB,J,2016,,,,,,Substance Abuse,,-1,,Substance Abuse,,6,Involvement of the GABA(A) Receptor in Age-Dependent Differences in Binge-Like Ethanol Intake,6,,WOS:000369998900020,1,40,1530-0277,26833274,C:\Users\mginda\Desktop\agc1\wos-extract.isi,"Quoilin C, 2016, V40, P408, DOI 10.1111/acer.12953"
"Objectives To determine adolescent and parent views of barriers to annual adolescent preventive care. Study design A nationally recruited cross-sectional study of adolescents between ages 13 and 18 years, and parents of adolescents from different families, were recruited. The primary outcome was self-report of preventive care in the last 12 months. Demographic, family health discussions, physical/emotional health importance, and preventive care barriers were gathered from adolescents and parents. Results The majority of the sample (500 adolescents and 504 parents in different families) reported a primary care visit within 12 months (parents = 78.7%; adolescents = 66.9%). Adolescent participants identified more barriers than parents (parents = 0.69; adolescents = 1.42). Adolescent who reported having discussions with parents about health (aOR 1.57, 95% CI 1.26-1.98) and seeing a subspecialist provider (aOR 3.72, CI 1.21-11.47) were more likely to report preventive visits. Barriers for parents and adolescents include the belief that an appointment is only needed when a child is sick (parent aOR 0.21, CI 0.08-0.61; adolescent aOR 0.29, CI 0.17-0.51) and family cannot afford cost (parent aOR 0.34, CI 0.15-0.81; adolescent aOR 0.50, CI 0.26-0.97). Barriers for parents include the child sees a specialist (aOR 0.26, CI 0.08-0.88) and their child does not need a checkup (aOR 0.12, CI 0.05-0.34). Lastly, a barrier for adolescents was parents never schedule preventive visits (aOR 0.31, CI 0.17-0.58). Conclusions The Affordable Care Act has the potential to limit preventive care barriers.

"Background: The study objective was to identify commonalities amongst family medicine physicians who endorse annual adolescent visits. Methods: A nationally weighted representative on-line survey was used to explore pediatrician (N = 204) and family medicine physicians (N = 221) beliefs and behaviors surrounding adolescent wellness. Our primary outcome was endorsement that adolescents should receive annual preventive care visits. Results: Pediatricians were significantly more likely (p <.01) to endorse annual well visits. Among family medicine physicians, bivariate comparisons were conducted between those who endorsed an annual visit (N = 164) compared to those who did not (N = 57) with significant predictors combined into two multivariate logistic regression models. Model 1 controlled for: patient race, proportion of 13-17 year olds in provider's practice, discussion beliefs scale and discussion behaviors with parents scale. Model 2 controlled for the same first three variables as well as discussion behaviors with adolescents scale. Model 1 showed for each discussion beliefs scale topic selected, family medicine physicians had 1.14 increased odds of endorsing annual visits (p < .001) and had 1.11 greater odds of endorsing annual visits with each one-point increase in discussion behaviors with parents scale (p =.51). Model 2 showed for each discussion beliefs scale topic selected, family medicine physicians had 1.15 increased odds of also endorsing the importance of annual visits (p < .001). Conclusions: Family medicine physicians that endorse annual visits are significantly more likely to affirm they hold strong beliefs about topics that should be discussed during the annual exam. They also act on these beliefs by talking to parents of teens about these topics. This group appears to focus on quality of care in thought and deed.",,,"Aalsma, MC|Gilbert, AL|Hensel, DJ|Rickert, VI|Taylor, JL","Aalsma, Matthew C.|Gilbert, Amy L.|Hensel, Devon J.|Rickert, Vaughn I.|Taylor, Jaime L.",,-1,,,,,,,-1,,-1,,,,,,,,Article,10.1186/s12875-016-0402-6,,,,,Clarivate Analytics Web of Science,,,,,,1471-2296,,,,BMC FAMILY PRACTICE,,,4,HEALTH|PARENTS,-1,,Adolescent|Preventive care|Primary care|Provider beliefs,,20-Jan,J,2016,,,,,,"Primary Health Care|Medicine, General & Internal",,-1,,General & Internal Medicine,,2,Perspectives of family medicine physicians on the importance of adolescent preventive care: a multivariate analysis,2,,WOS:000368388800001,1,17,,26791084,C:\Users\mginda\Desktop\agc1\wos-extract.isi,"Taylor JL, 2016, V17, DOI 10.1186/s12875-016-0402-6"
"Forty faculty members from eight schools participated in a year-long National Faculty Development Program (NFDP) conducted in 2012-2013, aimed at developing faculty knowledge and skills for interprofessional education (IPE). The NFDP included two live conferences. Between conferences, faculty teams implemented self-selected IPE projects at their home institutions and participated in coaching and peer-support conference calls. This paper describes program outcomes. A mixed methods approach was adopted. Data were gathered through online surveys and semi-structured interviews. The study explored whether faculty were satisfied with the program, believed the program was effective in developing knowledge and skills in designing, implementing, and evaluating IPE, and planned to continue newly-implemented IPE and faculty development (FD). Peer support and networking were two of the greatest perceived benefits. Further, this multi-institutional program appears to have facilitated early organizational change by bringing greater contextual understanding to assumptions made at the local level that in turn could influence hidden curricula and networking. These findings may guide program planning for future FD to support IPE.",,,"Abu-Rish Blakeney, E|Hall, LW|Jones, M|Pfeifle, AL|Zierler, BK","Abu-Rish Blakeney, Erin|Hall, Leslie Walter|Jones, Mandy|Pfeifle, Andrea L.|Zierler, Brenda K.",83,-1,,,,,,,-1,,-1,,,,,,,,Article,10.3109/13561820.2015.1051615,,,,89,Clarivate Analytics Web of Science,,,,,,1356-1820,1,,,JOURNAL OF INTERPROFESSIONAL CARE,,,,COLLABORATIVE PRACTICE|MEDICAL-EDUCATION|PRIMARY-CARE|HEALTH-CARE|IMPLEMENTATION|TEAMS,-1,"Blakeney, Erin/0000-0002-4902-181X",Evaluation|faculty development|interprofessional|interviews|mixed methods|qualitative|team-based care,,2-Jan,J,2016,,,,,,Health Care Sciences & Services|Health Policy & Services,,-1,,Health Care Sciences & Services,,2,Findings from a mixed-methods study of an interprofessional faculty development program,2,,WOS:000371380000013,1,30,1469-9567,26576839,C:\Users\mginda\Desktop\agc1\wos-extract.isi,"Abu-Rish Blakeney E, 2016, V30, P83, DOI 10.3109/13561820.2015.1051615"
"Background: RhEumAtic Disease activitY (READY) is a mobile health (mHealth) application that aims to create a shared platform integrating data from both patients and physicians, with a particular emphasis on arthritis disease activity. Methods: We made READY available on an iPad and pilot implemented it at a rheumatology outpatient clinic. We conducted 1) a usability evaluation study to explore patients' and physicians' interactions with READY, and 2) a time motion study (TMS) to observe the clinical workflow before and after the implementation. Results: A total of 33 patients and 15 physicians participated in the usability evaluation. We found usability problems in navigation, data entry, pain assessment, documentation, and instructions along with error messages. Despite these issues, 25 (75,76%) patients reported they liked READY. Physicians provided mixed feedback because they were concerned about the impact of READY on clinical workflow. Six physicians participated in the TMS. We observed 47 patient visits (44.72 hours) in the pre-implementation phase, and 42 patient visits (37.82 hours) in the post-implementation phase. We found that patients spent more time on READY than paper (4.39mins vs. 2.26mins), but overall, READY did not delay the workflow (pre = 52.08 mins vs. post = 45.46 mins). This time difference may be compensated with READY eliminating a workflow step for the staff. Conclusion: Patients preferred READY to paper documents. Many found it easier to input information because of the larger font size and the ease of 'tapping' rather than writing-out or circling answers.

"Objective: Texting while driving is highly prevalent among adolescents and young adults in the United States. Texting while driving can significantly increase the risk of road crashes and is associated with other risky driving behaviors. Most states have enacted distracted driving laws to prohibit texting while driving. This study examines effects of different all-driver distracted driving laws on texting while driving among high school students. Methods: High school student data were extracted from the 2013 National Youth Risk Behavior Survey. Distracted driving law information was collected from the National Conference of State Legislatures. The final sample included 6,168 high school students above the restricted driving age in their states and with access to a vehicle. Logistic regression was applied to estimate odds ratios of laws on texting while driving. Results: All-driver text messaging bans with primary enforcement were associated with a significant reduction in odds of texting while driving among high school students (odds ratio = 0.703; 95% confidence interval, 0.513-0.964), whereas all-driver phone use bans with primary enforcement did not have a significant association with texting while driving (odds ratio = 0.846; 95% confidence interval, 0.501-1.429). Conclusions: The findings indicate that all-driver distracted driving laws that specifically target texting while driving as opposed to all types of phone use are effective in reducing the behavior among high school students.",,,"Bell, TM|Qiao, N","Bell, Teresa M.|Qiao, Nan",5,-1,,,,,,,-1,,-1,,,,,,,,Article,10.1080/15389588.2015.1041112,,,,8,Clarivate Analytics Web of Science,,,,,,1538-9588,1,,,TRAFFIC INJURY PREVENTION,,,,CELL PHONE USE|CRASHES|NOVICE|RISK,-1,,distracted driving laws|texting while driving|high school students,,,J,2016,,,,,,"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health|Transportation",,-1,,"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health; Transportation",,3,State all-driver distracted driving laws and high school students' texting while driving behavior,3,,WOS:000378137300002,1,17,1538-957X,26042818,C:\Users\mginda\Desktop\agc1\wos-extract.isi,"Qiao N, 2016, V17, P5, DOI 10.1080/15389588.2015.1041112"
"Background: Cocaine use and its consequences are disproportionately higher and more severe among African Americans compared to other ethnic/racial groups. Objectives: The aims of this study were to examine a risk model specific for African American users and assess whether risk varies as a function of sex. Methods: 270 African American adults in a residential drug treatment facility completed measurements assessing first and past year crack/cocaine use frequency, childhood trauma, and stress reactivity. Multiple linear regression analysis was used to examine the unique effect of each predictor variable on past year crack/cocaine frequency. Sex was included as a moderator variable in the regression analysis. Results: All predictor variables were positively correlated with past year crack/cocaine use. However, sex differences were also observed: females reported higher rates of childhood emotional abuse, childhood sexual abuse, and stress reactivity-as well as past year crack use and cocaine use-than males. Regression analyses were performed with sex, first year use, and stress reactivity emerging as the only significant predictors for frequency of crack and cocaine use among all study participants. Moreover, sex differences were observed in the influence of first year crack use frequency on past year crack use frequency, such that the effect was stronger for males than for females. Conclusion/Importance: This study offers a clearer understanding of the risk factors for crack and cocaine abuse specific to African Americans, as well as sex specific pathways to risk, providing useful implications for future prevention and treatment efforts.",,,"Baldwin, P|Lejuez, CW|Zapolski, TCB","Baldwin, Patrick|Lejuez, Carl W.|Zapolski, Tamika C.

"Background: School is an important developmental context for adolescents and may be related to adolescent alcohol use. Less is known as to whether the relationships between school factors and alcohol use differ between Latino youth born outside of the United States versus those born in the United States. Objective: The aim of this study is to test nativity as a moderator of the relationship between school factors and alcohol use among Latino adolescents. Methods: This study used data from Waves I and II of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health) to test nativity as a moderator of the relationship between school factors and alcohol use in a subsample of Latino adolescents. Results: Results found that during adolescence, nativity moderates the relationship between school connectedness and Wave I alcohol use. For those born outside of the United States, school connectedness was not related to alcohol use. Significant main effects emerged for grades in school and truancy. Better grades were associated with less alcohol use, while truancy was associated with greater alcohol use. The longitudinal relationships between school factors and Wave II alcohol use were not statistically significant. Conclusions: School connectedness is a contemporaneous risk factor for alcohol use among those born in the United States. Prevention efforts that address school contextual factors may be important for all Latino students to reduce engagement in alcohol use and optimize well-being.",,,"Denton, LK|Escobar, OS|Martinez, S|Vaughan, EL","Denton, Lisa K.|Escobar, Oscar S.|Martinez, Sylvia|Vaughan, Ellen L.",742,-1,,,,,,,-1,,-1,,,,,,,,Article,10.3109/10826084.2016.1155603,,,,751,Clarivate Analytics Web of Science,,,,,,1082-6084,6,,,SUBSTANCE USE & MISUSE,,,,SUBSTANCE USE|MEXICAN-AMERICAN|PSYCHIATRIC-DISORDERS|PREVENTION PROGRAM|STRUCTURAL MODEL|UNITED-STATES|PUERTO-RICAN|USE PATHWAYS|DRUG-USE|STUDENTS,-1,,Adolescents|nativity|alcohol use|Hispanic/Latino|school connectedness|truancy,,,J,2016,,,,,,Substance Abuse|Psychiatry|Psychology,,-1,,Substance Abuse; Psychiatry; Psychology,,0,School Factors and Alcohol Use: The Moderating Effect of Nativity in a National Sample of Latino Adolescents,0,,WOS:000375482600008,1,51,1532-2491,27070949,C:\Users\mginda\Desktop\agc1\wos-extract.isi,"Vaughan EL, 2016, V51, P742, DOI 10.3109/10826084.2016.1155603"
"Background Relationship characteristics and day-to-day variation in affective state have been associated with HIV risk behaviour. However, no research has assessed the impact of these factors on event-level condom use among women engaging in transactional sex. Methods: Twenty-six women engaging in transactional sex were enrolled in a prospective study of their sexual health. They completed diaries about multi-level predictors of condom use during vaginal sex twice, daily. Results: Over 4 weeks, 18 participants reported 87 paid/traded vaginal intercourse events. Of these, 51.7% were condom protected. The majority of paid/traded events (81.5%) occurred with a non-romantic partner. After controlling for partner type, feeling in love on a given day was associated with higher odds of condom use during paid/traded sexual events, while having sex on the weekend and at night were associated with lower odds of condom use (all P0.05). There was a significant interaction between being in love and using condoms during transactional sex (P<0.01). In paid/traded sexual events with romantic partners, the frequency of condom use was 71.4% (5/7) when women did not report love and 40% (4/10) when love was reported. In sexual events with non-romantic partners, the frequency of condom use was 43.8% (14/32) when women did not report love and 59.5% (22/37) when love was reported. Conclusions: Women were less likely to report protected sex with romantic partners and more likely to report protected sex with non-romantic partners when they are in love. Interventions focusing on the link between day-to-day variation in affective state on condom use may help women with risk management across partner types.",,"Wiehe, Sarah/R-6083-2017","Fortenberry, JD|Hensel, DJ|Rosenberger, JG|Roth, AM|Wagner, KD|Wiehe, SE","Fortenberry, J.

"Objectives. We sought to estimate rates of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) among criminal offenders in the 1 year after arrest or release from incarceration. Methods. We performed a retrospective cohort study of risk of having a positive STI (chlamydia, gonorrhea, or syphilis) or incident-positive HIV test in the 1 year following arrest or incarceration in Marion County (Indianapolis), Indiana. Participants were 247 211 individuals with arrest or incarceration in jail, prison, or juvenile detention between 2003 and 2008. Results. Test positivity rates (per 100 000 and per year) were highest for chlamydia (2968) and gonorrhea (2305), and lower for syphilis (278) and HIV (61). Rates of positive STI and HIV were between 1.5 and 2.8 times higher in female than male participants and between 2.7 and 6.9 times higher for Blacks than Whites. Compared with nonoffenders, offenders had a relative risk of 3.9 for chlamydia, 6.6 for gonorrhea, 3.6 for syphilis, and 4.6 for HIV. Conclusions.

"Background: Studies evaluating the effect of smoking status on mortality outcomes in trauma patients have been limited, despite the fact that survival benefits of smoking have been reported in other critical care settings. The phenomenon ""smoker's paradox"" refers to the observation that following acute cardiovascular events, such as acute myocardial infarction and cardiac arrest, smokers often experience decreased mortality in the hospital setting. The objective of our study was to determine whether smoking imparts a survival benefit in patients with traumatic injuries. Methods: We performed a retrospective cohort study that analyzed cases included in the National Trauma Data Bank research dataset. Hierarchical logistic regression analyses were used to determine whether smoking alters the risk of mortality and complications in patients who smoke. Results: The percentage of patients experiencing mortality differed significantly between smokers (n = 38,564) and nonsmokers (n = 319,249) (1.8% vs. 4.3%, P < .001); however, the percentage experiencing a major complication did not (9.7% vs. 9.6%, P = .763). Regression analyses indicated that smokers were significantly less likely to die during the hospital stay compared to nonsmokers after adjusting for individual and hospital factors (OR = 0.15; CI = 0.10, 0.22). Additionally, smokers were also less likely to develop a major complication than nonsmokers (OR = 0.73, CI = 0.59-0.91). Conclusions: Patients who smoke appear to have a much lower risk of in-hospital mortality than nonsmokers. Further investigation into biological mechanisms responsible for this effect should be carried out in order to potentially develop therapeutic applications.",,,"Bayt, DR|Bell, TM|Zarzaur, BL","Bayt, Demetria R.|Bell, Teresa M.|Zarzaur, Ben L., Jr.",1499,-1,,,,,,,-1,,-1,,,,,,,,Article,10.1093/ntr/ntv027,,,,1504,Clarivate Analytics Web of Science,,,,,,1462-2203,12,,,NICOTINE & TOBACCO RESEARCH,,,,ACUTE MYOCARDIAL-INFARCTION|HYPOXIA-REOXYGENATION INJURY|ISCHEMIA-REPERFUSION INJURY|PASSIVE CIGARETTE-SMOKING|PATHWAY MODULATES GUT|ANTIINFLAMMATORY PATHWAY|HEMORRHAGIC-SHOCK|LUNG INJURY|PHARMACOLOGICAL STIMULATION|IMPROVED SURVIVAL,-1,,,,DEC,J,2015,,,,,,"Substance Abuse|Public, Environmental & Occupational Health",,-1,,"Substance Abuse; Public, Environmental & Occupational Health",,1,"""Smoker's Paradox"" in Patients Treated for Severe Injuries: Lower Risk of Mortality After Trauma Observed in Current Smokers",1,,WOS:000368441000013,1,17,1469-994X,25646350,C:\Users\mginda\Desktop\agc1\wos-extract.isi,"Bell TM, 2015, V17, P1499, DOI 10.1093/ntr/ntv027"
"Purpose: Facial fractures in the pediatric population have a significant impact on public health. Although some demographic data exists regarding the overall epidemiology of facial fractures, little attention has been paid to the patterns of facial fractures based on the etiology of the trauma. Material and methods: The Kids' Inpatient Database 2000-2009 was utilized to analyze pediatric facial fractures. A total of 21,533 patients were identified. Associations of patient characteristics with outcomes of interest were assessed. Results: The top three etiologies were motor vehicle accident (MVA), intentional trauma (IT), and falls. There was a decrease in the incidence of facial fractures due to MVAs and an increase in injuries due to IT and falls. Concomitant injuries were present in 58.8% and the mortality rate was 2%. The rate of concomitant injuries increased during study period. Age was significantly associated with concomitant injury, mortality, and LOS. Conclusion: The increasing rate of IT and falls with concomitant injury warrants special consideration to reduce undiagnosed accompanying injuries. Further programs should be put in place to protect children younger than 5 years of age, who have increased risk of concomitant injury and mortality following intentional trauma.

"Purpose: Studies examining postinjury functional status have demonstrated that individuals with severe injuries often do not return to baseline levels of physical functioning. We sought to investigate the impact injuries have on changes in physical functioning across the life course of older adults. The study's objectives were to (1) identify trajectories of long-term functional limitations after injury in the older adult population to better characterize the recovery process and (2) predict which individuals are most at risk for poor functional trajectories after injury. Methods: A retrospective cohort study was conducted using six waves of data from the Health and Retirement Study, which surveys Americans older than 50 years every two years. A group-based trajectory model was used to identify trajectories of functional limitations in injured participants. Using multivariate regression, we identified significant predictors of each trajectory. Results: Five distinct trajectories were identified: Trajectory 1 consistently low functional limitations scores (18.9%), Trajectory 2 increase in functional limitations after injury followed by a gradual, incomplete recovery (46.3%). Trajectory 3 increase in functional limitations followed by further decline in functioning (10.5%), Trajectory 4 increase in functional limitations after injury followed by a gradual, complete recovery (13.4%), and Trajectory 5 consistently high functional limitations scores (10.8%). Gender, multiple health conditions, and insurance status predicted trajectory membership. Conclusions: Functional limitations after injury follow distinct trajectories that can be predicted by baseline individual characteristics. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

"Background: Global health experiences evoke a profound awareness of cultural differences, inspire learners to prioritize professional values, and provide a lens for addressing global health care challenges. This study compares the long-term career and practice choices of participants in a 2-month Indiana University-Moi University, Kenya elective from 1989-2013 with those of a control group. Methods: Global health elective (GHE) participants and a random sample of alumni without GHE experience were surveyed on their clinical practice, public health and global health activities. Results: Responses from 176 former participants were compared with a control group of 177 alumni. GHE participants were more likely than similar controls to provide care to underserved U.S. populations (p=0.037), spend time in global health, public health, and public policy activities (p=0.005) and be involved in global health advocacy (p=0.001). Using multivariable analysis, GHE participants were more likely to be generalists (p < 0.05), report that healthcare costs influenced medical decision-making (p < 0.05), and provide healthcare outside the U.S. for >= 1 week/year (p < 0.001). Conclusions: Many years out of training, GHE participants were more likely to be generalists working with underserved populations, to be cost-conscious in their healthcare decision-making, and to be involved in global health, public health or public policy.

"With the ultimate goal of improving child outcomes, child-informed mediation approaches were developed for divorcing and separating parents. To test the initial outcomes of these approaches, Ballard, Holtzworth-Munroe, Applegate, D'Onofrio, and Bates (2013) randomly assigned divorcing parents seeking mediation to either mediation as usual (MAU) or to 1 of 2 child-informed mediation approaches [i.e., child-inclusive (CI) or child-focused (CF) mediation]. As Ballard et al. (2013) only presented outcomes at the conclusion of mediation, the current study examined the frequency of relitigation across the study conditions (MAU vs. CF/CI; CF vs. CI), and explored associations between relitigation and content of the mediation agreements. Consistent with our hypothesis, parents assigned to MAU in comparison with CF/CI, as well as CF in comparison with CI, had more motions, hearings, and orders in the year following the final resolution of mediation issues. The differences between MAU and CF/CI were small in magnitude and statistically nonsignificant trends; the differences between CF and CI were medium to large in magnitude and statistically significant. Mediation agreements that included aspirational language about coparental communication and the parent-child relationship, provisions about communication between parents, and were rated as higher in facilitating the coparental relationship, and child-adjustment, were associated with less relitigation. Number of weeknights allotted to the nonresidential parent was also related to fewer motions. The implications of these findings for family mediation are discussed.",,,"Applegate, AG|D'Onofrio, BM|Holtzworth-Munroe, A|Ogle, RK|Rudd, BN","Applegate, Amy G.|D'Onofrio, Brian M.|Holtzworth-Munroe, Amy|Ogle, Rachel K.|Rudd, Brittany N.",452,-1,,,,,,,-1,,-1,,,,,,,,Article,10.1037/law0000046,,,,457,Clarivate Analytics Web of Science,,,,,,1076-8971,4,,,PSYCHOLOGY PUBLIC POLICY AND LAW,,,,PARENTAL DIVORCE|ADJUSTMENT,-1,,family mediation|child informed mediation|family law interventions,,NOV,J,2015,,,,,,"Health Policy & Services|Law|Psychology, Multidisciplinary",,-1,,Health Care Sciences & Services; Government & Law; Psychology,,4,Child-Informed Mediation Study Follow-Up: Comparing the Frequency of Relitigation Following Different Types of Family Mediation,4,,WOS:000365081300012,1,21,1939-1528,,C:\Users\mginda\Desktop\agc1\wos-extract.isi,"Rudd BN, 2015, V21, P452, DOI 10.1037/law0000046"

"Although many reviews exist characterizing the molecular differences of GABA(B) receptor isoforms, there is no current review of the in vivo effects of these isoforms. The current review focuses on whether the GABA(B1a) and GABA(B1b) isoforms contribute differentially to behaviors in isoform knockout mice. The roles of these receptors have primarily been characterized in cognitive, anxiety, and depressive phenotypes. Currently, the field supports a role of GABA(B1a) in memory maintenance and protection against an anhedonic phenotype, whereas GABA(B1b) appears to be involved in memory formation and a susceptibility to developing an anhedonic phenotype. Although GABA(B) receptors have been strongly implicated in drug abuse phenotypes, no isoform-specific work has been done in this field. Future directions include developing site-specific isoform knockdown to identify the role of different brain regions in behavior, as well as identifying how these isoforms are involved in development of behavioral phenotypes.

"Objectives Preconception maternal bereavement may be associated with an increased risk for infant mortality, although these previously reported findings have not been replicated. We sought to examine if the association could be replicated and explore if risk extended into childhood. Methods Using a Danish population-based sample of offspring born 1979 to 2009 (N = 1,865,454), we analyzed neonatal (0-28 days), postneonatal infant (29-364 days), and early childhood (1-5 years) mortality after maternal bereavement in the preconception (6-0 months before pregnancy) and prenatal (between conception and birth) periods. Maternal bereavement was defined as death of a first-degree relative of the mother. Analyses were conducted using logistic and log-linear Poisson regressions that were adjusted for offspring, mother, and father sociodemographic and health factors. Results We identified 6541 (0.004%) neonates, 3538 (0.002%) postneonates, and 2132 (0.001%) children between the ages of 1 and 5 years who died. After adjusting for covariates, bereavement during the preconception period was associated with increased odds of neonatal (adjusted odds ratio = 1.87, 95% confidence interval = 1.53-2.30) and postneonatal infant mortality (adjusted odds ratio = 1.52, 95% confidence interval = 1.15-2.02). Associations were timing specific (6 months before pregnancy only) and consistent across sensitivity analyses. Bereavement during the prenatal period was not consistently associated with increased risk of offspring mortality; however, this may reflect relatively low statistical power. Conclusions Results support and extend previous findings linking bereavement during the preconception period with increased odds of early offspring mortality. The period immediately before pregnancy may be a sensitive period with potential etiological implications and ramifications for offspring mortality.",,,"Class, QA|Dalman, C|D'Onofrio, BM|Henriksen, TB|Khashan, AS|Mortensen, PB","Class, Quetzal A.|Dalman, Christina|D'Onofrio, Brian M.|Henriksen, Tine B.|Khashan, Ali S.|Mortensen, Preben B.",863,-1,,,,,,,-1,,-1,,,,,,,,Article,10.1097/PSY.0000000000000229,,,,869,Clarivate Analytics Web of Science,,,,,,0033-3174,8,,,PSYCHOSOMATIC MEDICINE,,,,LIFE EVENTS|SPONTANEOUS-ABORTION|DEATH-SYNDROME|COHORT|RISK|STRESS|STILLBIRTH|PREGNANCY|PRETERM|HEALTH,-1,"Mortensen, Preben Bo/0000-0002-5230-9865",bereavement|infant mortality|preconception|prenatal|stress|CI = confidence interval|OR = odds ratio|RR = relative risk,,OCT,J,2015,,,,,,"Psychiatry|Psychology|Psychology, Multidisciplinary",,-1,,Psychiatry; Psychology,,3,Preconception Maternal Bereavement and Infant and Childhood Mortality: A Danish Population-Based Study,3,,WOS:000362707700003,1,77,1534-7796,26374948,C:\Users\mginda\Desktop\agc1\wos-extract.isi,"Class QA, 2015, V77, P863, DOI 10.1097/PSY.0000000000000229"
"Despite a lack of research on parent education programs for unmarried parents, many judicial officers mandate participation. We recruited an understudied sample likely at high risk for negative outcomes-182 court cases involving unmarried parents on government assistance in which paternity was contested and then established via genetic testing ordered by the court. This 2 x 2 randomized controlled trial evaluated the impact on initial litigation outcomes of two factors: (a) participation in an online parent education program or not and (b) having a waiting period between the establishment of paternity and the court hearing concerning child-related issues or not. Using an intent-to-treat framework, we found that among cases not assigned to the program, there was no difference in the rate of full agreement on child-related issues (e.g., child support, custody, parenting time) when comparing cases assigned to a waiting period and cases not assigned to a waiting period. In contrast, for cases assigned to the program, cases also assigned a waiting period were less likely to reach a full agreement than cases that had their hearing on the same day. In addition, cases in the ""program and waiting period"" condition were less likely to return to court for their hearing than cases in the ""no program and waiting period"" condition. In exploratory analyses of the subsample of cases in which both parents were present at the court hearing, the pattern of results remained the same, although the findings were no longer statistically significant.",,,"Applegate, AG|D'Onofrio, BM|Holtzworth-Munroe, A|Reyome, JG|Rudd, BN","Applegate, Amy G.|D'Onofrio, Brian M.|Holtzworth-Munroe, Amy|Reyome, Jason G.|Rudd, Brittany N.",679,-1,,,,,,,-1,,-1,,,,,,,,Article,10.1037/fam0000106,,,,686,Clarivate Analytics Web of Science,,,,,,0893-3200,5,,,JOURNAL OF FAMILY PSYCHOLOGY,,,,DIVORCE,-1,,unmarried parents|Title IV-D|contested paternity|paternity establishment|online parent education,,OCT,J,2015,,,,,,"Psychology, Clinical|Family Studies",,-1,,Psychology; Family Studies,,4,Randomized Control Trial: Online Parent Program and Waiting Period for Unmarried Parents in Title IV-D Court,4,,WOS:000362510200003,1,29,1939-1293,26075738,C:\Users\mginda\Desktop\agc1\wos-extract.isi,"Rudd BN, 2015, V29, P679, DOI 10.1037/fam0000106"
"We examined the association between parents' (N = 52 mothers and 52 fathers) and children's (N = 27) reports of interparental conflict and child difficulties in a family mediation setting. Parents' reports of conflict were moderately associated with children's reports of exposure to parental conflict, but only fathers' reports of conflict were associated with children's reports of negative responses to parent conflict. While mothers and fathers agreed on their child's difficulties, only mothers', not fathers', report of child difficulties were moderately related to child reports of child difficulties. Mothers' and fathers' reports of conflict generally were not strongly associated with reports of child difficulties. In contrast to parent reports, children's reports of exposure to parents' conflict were moderately and significantly related to self-reported child difficulties and moderately related to parents' reports of child academic difficulties. The magnitude of the association between the child's report of interparental conflict and self-report of difficulties was stronger than the association between parent report of conflict and parent report of child difficulties, suggesting that parents may not fully understand their child's exposure to parent conflict/violence or the problems their child is experiencing. Key Points for the Family Court Community: Family law stakeholders prioritize the creation of parenting arrangements that are in the best interest of the child; however, it is unclear how to gather information about the child and the child's perspective in order to inform such arrangements. The study results suggest that parents may not agree with each other or with the child about important family issues, such as parent conflict and child difficulties. For example, parents may not fully understand their child's exposure to parental conflict/violence when in the midst of custody negotiations. More research is needed to determine the best method for gathering information about the child during custody proceedings.

"Research has indicated that Hispanics have high rates of heavy drinking and depressive symptoms during late adolescence. The purpose of this study was to test a bicultural transaction model composed of two enthnocultural orientations (acculturation and enculturation); and stressful cultural transactions with both the U.S. culture (perceived ethnic discrimination) and Hispanic culture (perceived intragroup marginalization) to predict alcohol use severity and depressive symptoms among a sample of 129 (men = 39, women = 90) late adolescent Hispanics (ages 18-21) enrolled in college. Results from a path analysis indicated that the model accounted for 18.2% of the variance in alcohol use severity and 24.3% of the variance in depressive symptoms. None of the acculturation or enculturation domains had statistically significant direct effects with alcohol use severity or depressive symptoms. However, higher reports of ethnic discrimination were associated with higher reports of alcohol use severity and depressive symptoms. Similarly, higher reports of intragroup marginalization were associated with higher depressive symptoms. Further, both ethnic discrimination and intragroup marginalization functioned as mediators of multiple domains of acculturation and enculturation. These findings highlight the need to consider the indirect effects of enthnocultural orientations in relation to health-related outcomes. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

"Background: Identifying and understanding determinants of alcohol use behavior among Hispanic college students is an increasingly important public health issue, particularly during emerging adulthood. Studies examining ethnocultural determinants of alcohol use behavior among Hispanic college students have focused on direct associations with cultural orientation (e.g., acculturation and enculturation); yet there is a need for research that accounts for the complex interplay of other culturally relevant sociocultural factors. Objectives: This study examined associations of behavioral acculturation, behavioral enculturation, and cultural congruity (perception of cultural fit between the values of the academic environment and the student's personal values) with alcohol use severity (AUS); and tested if gender moderated those associations. Methods: A hierarchical linear regression and moderation analysis were conducted on a sample of 167 Hispanic emerging adults (ages 18-25) enrolled in college. Results: All predictor variables entered in the regression model accounted for 20.9% of the variance in AUS. After controlling for demographic variables and depressive symptoms, behavioral acculturation and enculturation did not have a statistically significant association with AUS. Further, gender did not moderate either of these associations. Conversely, greater cultural congruity was associated with lower reports of AUS. A moderation analysis suggested that cultural congruity predicted lower reports of AUS among men, but not among women. Conclusions: This was the first known study to examine the association of cultural congruity with alcohol use. Findings highlight the value of examining contextual factors of culture and moving beyond reductive measures of cultural orientation.",,"Cano, Miguel Angel/V-8215-2017","Cano, MA|Castro, Y|de Dios, MA|Ojeda, L|Roncancio, AM|Vaughan, EL","Cano, Miguel Angel|Castro, Yessenia|de Dios, Marcel A.|Ojeda, Lizette|Roncancio, Angelica M.|Vaughan, Ellen L.",1412,-1,,,,,,,-1,,-1,,,,,,,,Article,10.3109/10826084.2015.1018538,,,,1420,Clarivate Analytics Web of Science,,,,,,1082-6084,11,,,SUBSTANCE USE & MISUSE,,,,AMERICAN COLLEGE-STUDENTS|SOCIAL SUPPORT|UNIVERSITY ENVIRONMENT|MEXICAN-AMERICANS|SUBSTANCE USE|ACCULTURATION|PREDICTORS|DISTRESS|GENDER|SCALE,-1,"Cano, Miguel Angel/0000-0002-9847-1358",cultural congruity|acculturation|alcohol|Hispanic|emerging adults|college students,,19-Sep,J,2015,,,,,,Substance Abuse|Psychiatry|Psychology,,-1,,Substance Abuse; Psychiatry; Psychology,,4,Alcohol Use Severity Among Hispanic Emerging Adults in Higher Education: Understanding the Effect of Cultural Congruity,4,,WOS:000364823800006,1,50,1532-2491,26574656,C:\Users\mginda\Desktop\agc1\wos-extract.isi,"Cano MA, 2015, V50, P1412, DOI 10.3109/10826084.2015.1018538"

"A majority of detained adolescents experience mental health and substance use problems. Limited research has examined the interaction between the race/ethnicity of an individual youth and county-level racial heterogeneity on adolescent mental health outcomes. Participants were identified through a statewide mental health screening project that took place in detention centers across 11 different counties in a Midwestern state during January 1, 2008, to May 10, 2010. A total of 23,831 detained youth (ages 11-18 years), identified as non-Hispanic White (46.6%), Black (43.5%), or Hispanic (9.8%), completed a mental health screener that assessed problems in alcohol/drug use, depression-anxiety, anger-irritability, trauma, somatic complaints, and suicide ideation. Census data were gathered to determine the racial heterogeneity of each county and other county-level variables. Hierarchical linear regression analyses were used to test the independent and interactive effects of youth race/ethnicity and county-level variables (including racial heterogeneity of the county) on adolescent mental health. Independent of other community characteristics, as county-level racial heterogeneity increased, mental health problems among detained youth decreased. In future research on the development and persistence of mental health problems in detained youth, both community and individual-level factors should be considered.",,"Wiehe, Sarah/R-6083-2017","Aalsma, MC|Holloway, ED|Lau, KSL|Vachon, DD|Wiehe, SE","Aalsma, Matthew C.|Holloway, Evan D.|Lau, Katherine S.

"Objective: The aim of this investigation was to test hypothesized reverse prospective relationships between alcohol consumption and depressive symptomatology as a function of race among youth. Method: In a two-wave prospective study, 328 European American, 328 African American, and 144 Hispanic American youth were studied at the end of fifth grade (last year of elementary school) and the end of sixth grade (first year of middle school). Results: A positive correlation was observed between alcohol consumption and depressive symptoms among all youth. However, the predictive relationship differed based on race. For European American and Hispanic American youth, depressive symptom levels at the end of elementary school predicted alcohol consumption at the end of the first year of middle school, but the converse relationship was not observed. For African American youth, the opposite pattern was found. Alcohol consumption at the end of elementary school predicted depressive symptom levels at the end of the first year of middle school, and the converse relationship was not observed. Conclusions: These findings suggest the possibility that etiological relationships between depression and alcohol use vary by race, thus highlighting the importance of considering race when studying the risk process.",,,"Birkley, EL|Smith, GT|Zapolski, TCB","Birkley, Erica L.|Smith, Gregoty T.|Zapolski, Tamika C.

"A 2013 survey of Indiana local health departments (sLHDs) measured accreditation activity and progress. Reported activities were categorized using the Public Health Accreditation Board's (PHAB's) accreditation steps as a guiding framework and matched with selected sociodemographic, organizational, and technical assistance variables. Findings indicated that 42 (59.2%) of responding Indiana LHDs reported pursuing accreditation.. Of LHDs pursuing accreditation, 21 were at the initial introductory step, 18 were at the prerequisite step, one reported submitting an application to PHAB, and two reported no activity, yet intent to pursue accreditation. Reported receipt of technical assistance was associated with accreditation progress (p=0.01) and, specifically, with being at the prerequisite step. Facilitating the pursuit of LHD accreditation in states with low public health investment is possible with targeted accreditation resources. Finding meaningful measures of accreditation progress will help advance the study of factors associated with LHD accreditation on a broad scale and for the long term.",,,"Barnes, PR|Degi, LS|Halverson, PK|King, J|Meyerson, BE|Polmanski, HF","Barnes, Priscilla R.|Degi, Lindsey S.|Halverson, Paul K.|King, Jerry|Meyerson, Beth E.|Polmanski, Haley F.",447,-1,,,,,,,-1,,-1,,,,,,,,Article,10.1177/003335491513000507,,,,452,Clarivate Analytics Web of Science,,,,,,0033-3549,5,,,PUBLIC HEALTH REPORTS,,,,PUBLIC-HEALTH|QUALITY IMPROVEMENT|INCENTIVES|LESSONS|STATES,-1,,,,SEP-OCT,J,2015,,,,,,"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health",,-1,,"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health",,2,"Measuring Accreditation Activity and Progress: Findings from a Survey of Indiana Local Health Departments, 2013",2,,WOS:000361084800007,1,130,,26327722,C:\Users\mginda\Desktop\agc1\wos-extract.isi,"Meyerson BE, 2015, V130, P447, DOI 10.1177/003335491513000507"
"Middle school addictive behavior involvement is highly predictive of future dysfunction. We tested whether a set of high-risk personality traits, measured in elementary school, predicted drinking, smoking, and binge eating in middle school. We studied 1,906 children in two waves: Wave 1 was the last year of elementary school and wave 2 was the first year of middle school in the participating schools. In a design controlling for sex, pubertal status, prior engagement in addictive behaviors, and other high-risk personality traits, we found that (a) fifth grade urgency, the tendency to act rashly when emotional, predicted drinking, smoking, and binge eating during sixth grade; and (b) fifth grade low conscientiousness, which reflects a failure to plan ahead or persevere on tasks, predicted drinking and smoking during sixth grade. It appears that high-risk middle school addictive behavior can itself be predicted from individual differences present in elementary school.

"We recently observed that the addition of caffeine (a nonselective adenosine receptor antagonist) to a 20% ethanol solution significantly altered the intoxication profile of male C57BL/6J (B6) mice induced by voluntary binge-like consumption in the 'Drinking-in-the-Dark' (DID) paradigm. In the current study, the roles of A(1) and A(2A) adenosine receptor subtypes, specifically, in binge-like ethanol consumption and associated locomotor effects were explored. Adult male B6 mice (PND 60-70) were allowed to consume 20% ethanol (v/v) or 2% sucrose (w/v) for 6 days via DID. On day 7, mice received a systemic administration (i.p.) of the A(1) antagonist DPCPX (1, 3, 6 mg/kg), the A(2A) antagonist MSX-3 (1, 2, 4 mg/kg), or vehicle immediately prior to fluid access in DID. Antagonism of the A(1) receptor via DPCPX was found to dose-dependently decrease binge-like ethanol intake and associated blood ethanol concentrations (p's < 0.05), although no effect was observed on sucrose intake. Antagonism of A(2A) had no effect on ethanol or sucrose consumption, however, MSX-3 elicited robust locomotor stimulation in mice consuming either solution (p's <0.05). Together, these findings suggest unique roles for the A(1) and A(2A) adenosine receptor subtypes in binge-like ethanol intake and its associated locomotor effects.

"The high demands and responsibilities of probation work, particularly with juvenile clients, may lead to burnout, which can negatively impact how probation officers work with clients, particularly individuals with behavioral health concerns. Yet, research examining burnout and related outcomes among juvenile probation officers (JPOs) is limited. We surveyed 246 JPOs in a Midwestern state to identify the prevalence, predictors, and potential outcomes of burnout. JPOs reported moderate levels of burnout; about 30% of the sample scored in the high range for emotional exhaustion and cynicism. Contrary to study hypotheses, there were no group-level differences in burnout scores across gender, race/ethnicity, age, or education. In regression models, burnout was predicted by being White (vs. minority), serving in an urban (vs. rural) county, dissatisfaction with department guidelines, job dissatisfaction, viewing job role as more treatment-oriented along the enforcement-treatment continuum, and turnover intention. JPOs with burnout were more likely to endorse mental health stigma and lack of mental health competency to address juvenile clients with behavioral health concerns. Findings suggest burnout prevention and intervention programs should be considered for JPOs to increase job satisfaction, limit job turnover, reduce burnout, and possibly increase effective practices for managing juvenile clients with behavioral health needs.",,,"Aalsma, MC|Adams, EL|Holloway, ED|Salyers, MP|White, LM","Aalsma, Matthew C.|Adams, Erin L.|Holloway, Evan D.|Salyers, Michelle P.|White, Laura M.",291,-1,,,,,,,-1,,-1,,,,,,,,Article,10.1037/ser0000031,,,,302,Clarivate Analytics Web of Science,,,,,,1541-1559,3,,,PSYCHOLOGICAL SERVICES,,,,DIFFERENT OCCUPATIONAL GROUPS|INVENTORY-GENERAL SURVEY|CORRECTIONAL OFFICERS|FACTORIAL VALIDITY|DIAGNOSTIC SURVEY|ATTITUDES|SATISFACTION|BEHAVIOR|STRESS|COLLABORATION,-1,"Holloway, Evan/0000-0002-6888-8398",burnout|probation officers|juvenile justice|stigma|mental health competency,,AUG,J,2015,,,,,,"Psychology, Clinical",,-1,,Psychology,,3,Job-Related Burnout Among Juvenile Probation Officers: Implications for Mental Health Stigma and Competency,3,,WOS:000358689300012,1,12,1939-148X,26009896,C:\Users\mginda\Desktop\agc1\wos-extract.isi,"White LM, 2015, V12, P291, DOI 10.1037/ser0000031"
"Purpose: Measuring activity spaces, places adolescents spend time, provides information about relations between contextual exposures and risk behaviors. We studied whether contextual exposures in adolescents' activity spaces differ from contextual risks present in residential contexts and examined relationships between contextual exposures in activity spaces and alcohol/marijuana use. Methods: Adolescents (N = 18) aged 16-17 years carried global positioning system (GPS)-enabled smartphones for 1 week, with locations tracked. Activity spaces were created by connecting global positioning system points sequentially and adding buffers. Contextual exposure data (e.g., alcohol outlets) were connected to routes. Adolescents completed texts regarding behaviors. Results: Adolescent activity spaces intersected 24.3 census tracts and contained nine times more alcohol outlets than that of residential census tracts. Outlet exposure in activity spaces was related to drinking. Low-socioeconomic status exposure was related to marijuana use. Conclusions: Findings suggest substantial differences between activity spaces and residential contexts and suggest that activity spaces are relevant for adolescent risk behaviors.

MCF were most commonly general (25%), oncology (19%), or transplant surgeons (15%). Fifty-one-percent of MCF had current/former NIH funding, compared with 20% of the rest (p<0.05); funding rates for R01/U01/P01 grants was 25.1% vs. 6.8% (p<0.05). Rate of current-NIH MCF funding correlated with higher total departmental NIH rank (p < 0.05). Conclusions Departmental academic productivity as defined by citations and NIH funding is highly driven by sections or divisions of research, general and transplantation surgery. MCF, regardless of subspecialty, contribute disproportionally to major grants and publications. Approaches that attract, develop, and retain funded MCF may be associated with dramatic increases in total departmental citations and NIH-funding.",,,"Bell, TM|Blanton, C|Dunnington, GL|Joshi, MM|Kim, BJ|Koniaris, LG|Nakeeb, A|Valsangkar, NP|Zimmers, TA","Bell, Teresa M.|Blanton, Casi|Dunnington, Gary L.|Joshi, Mugdha M.|Kim, Bradford J.|Koniaris, Leonidas G.|Nakeeb, Attila|Valsangkar, Nakul P.|Zimmers, Teresa A.",,-1,,,,,,,-1,,-1,,,,,,,,Article,10.1371/journal.pone.0131678,,,,,Clarivate Analytics Web of Science,,,,,,1932-6203,7,,,PLOS ONE,,,e0131678,PUBLICATION PRODUCTIVITY|SURGICAL SPECIALTIES|CLINICIAN-EDUCATORS|PROMOTION CRITERIA|SCIENTIFIC IMPACT|SCHOLARLY IMPACT|UNITED-STATES|DEPARTMENTS|INDEX,-1,"Zimmers, Teresa/0000-0001-7872-0540",,,15-Jul,J,2015,,,,,,Multidisciplinary Sciences,,-1,,Science & Technology - Other Topics,,18,"Determining the Drivers of Academic Success in Surgery: An Analysis of 3,850 Faculty",18,,WOS:000358197600058,1,10,,26177096,C:\Users\mginda\Desktop\agc1\wos-extract.isi,"Valsangkar NP, 2015, V10, DOI 10.1371/journal.pone.0131678"
"Background: Hispanic college students represent a growing proportion of the college population. Studies have found that an individual's perception of the drinking of others is linked to one's own personal use and that college students frequently overestimate the drinking of their peers. The current study builds on previous college student drinking literature by examining the influence that attending a Hispanic-serving institution (HSI) has on the personal alcohol use and perception of peers' drinking norms among Hispanic college students. Methods: This secondary data analysis utilized data from the American College Health Association's National College Health Assessment. Participants were self-identified Hispanics between the ages of 18 and 25 (N = 4336). Results: Results indicated that there was a significant interaction between attending an HSI and the perception of the number of drinks of a typical student. Specifically, the perception of others' drinking was more strongly linked to personal drinking for students in non-Hispanic serving institutions. Conclusions: The protective effect of attending a Hispanic-serving institution may be related to a more culturally affirming college environment.",,,"Chang, TK|de Dios, MA|Escobar, OS|Vaughan, EL","Chang, Tiffany K.|de Dios, Marcel A.|Escobar, Oscar S.|Vaughan, Ellen L.",314,-1,,,,,,,-1,,-1,,,,,,,,Article,10.1080/08897077.2014.932887,,,,317,Clarivate Analytics Web of Science,,,,,,0889-7077,3,,,SUBSTANCE ABUSE,,,,,-1,,Alcohol|Hispanic/Latino|norms,,3-Jul,J,2015,,,,,,Substance Abuse,,-1,,Substance Abuse,,3,Enrollment in Hispanic Serving Institutions as a Moderator of the Relationship Between Drinking Norms and Quantity of Alcohol Use Among Hispanic College Students,3,,WOS:000360294600009,1,36,1547-0164,24960534,C:\Users\mginda\Desktop\agc1\wos-extract.isi,"Vaughan EL, 2015, V36, P314, DOI 10.1080/08897077.2014.932887"
"Objectives. We examined the provision of behavioral health services to youths detained in Indiana between 2008 and 2012 and the impact of services on recidivism. Method. We obtained information about behavioral health needs, behavioral health treatment received, and recidivism within 12 months after release for 8363 adolescents (aged 12-18 years; 79.4% male). We conducted survival analyses to determine whether behavioral health services significantly affected time to recidivating. Results. Approximately 19.1% of youths had positive mental health screens, and 25.3% of all youths recidivated within 12 months after release. Of youths with positive screens, 29.2% saw a mental health clinician, 16.1% received behavioral health services during detention, and 30.0% received referrals for postdetention services. Survival analyses showed that being male, Black, and younger, and having higher scores on the substance use or irritability subscales of the screen predicted shorter time to recidivism. Receiving a behavior precaution, behavioral health services in detention, or an assessment in the community also predicted shorter time to recidivating. Conclusions. Findings support previous research showing that behavioral health problems are related to recidivism and that Black males are disproportionately rearrested after detention.",,,"Aalsma, MC|Grisso, T|Lau, KSL|Monahan, PO|Perkins, AJ|White, LM","Aalsma, Matthew C.|Grisso, Thomas|Lau, Katherine S.

"Background Intimate partner violence (IPV) research has primarily focused on heterosexual couples but has largely ignored IPV among men who have sex with men (MSM). We examined IPV prevalence among MSM and men who have sex with men and women (MSMW) in China. Methods Men who have sex with men older than 16 years were recruited through 3 MSM-focused Web sites in China. An online survey containing items on sociodemographics, risk behaviors, IPV, and self-reported HIV or sexually transmitted infection diagnosis was completed. Multivariate regression was used to examine associations between IPV and risk behaviors and an HIV or sexually transmitted infection diagnosis. Results Among 610 participants, 182 (29.8%) reported experiencing at least 1 type of IPV. Men who have sex with both men and women were at significantly greater risk for IPV (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 1.65; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.08-2.53) compared with MSM. Men who had experienced IPV were more likely to have participated in group sex (AOR, 1.86; 95% CI, 1.08-3.21), to have had sex in exchange for gifts or money (AOR, 5.06; 95% CI, 2.47-10.35), and to report a positive HIV diagnosis (AOR, 2.59; 95% CI, 1.22-5.51). Conclusions There is a hidden epidemic of IPV among MSM in China, especially among MSMW. The hidden nature of MSM and MSMW suggests the need for a clinical environment more conducive to disclosure. Research is needed to understand the pathways linking IPV and HIV risk among MSM to optimize the design of effective interventions.",,,"Aalsma, MC|Best, J|Davis, A|Dodge, B|Luo, JH|Meyerson, BE|Tucker, JD|Van der Pol, BJ|Wei, CY","Aalsma, Matthew C.|Best, John|Davis, Alissa|Dodge, Brian|Luo, Juhua|Meyerson, Beth E.|Tucker, Joseph D.|Van der Pol, Barbara J.|Wei, Chongyi",387,-1,,,,,,,-1,,-1,,,,,,,,Article,10.1097/OLQ.0000000000000302,,,,392,Clarivate Analytics Web of Science,,,Social Entrepreneurship Sexual,,,0148-5717,7,,,SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED DISEASES,,,,BISEXUAL MEN|HIV RISK|IDENTITY|DISCORDANCE|POPULATION|PREVALENCE|GAY|INTERVENTIONS|METAANALYSIS|SHANGHAI,-1,"Dodge, Brian/0000-0003-4491-6603; Tucker, Joseph/0000-0003-2804-1181; Van Der Pol, Barbara/0000-0003-3064-8564",,,JUL,J,2015,,,,,,Infectious Diseases,,-1,,Infectious Diseases,,8,Intimate Partner Violence and Correlates With Risk Behaviors and HIV/STI Diagnoses Among Men Who Have Sex With Men and Men Who Have Sex With Men and Women in China: A Hidden Epidemic,8,,WOS:000356491700007,1,42,1537-4521,26222752,C:\Users\mginda\Desktop\agc1\wos-extract.isi,"Davis A, 2015, V42, P387, DOI 10.1097/OLQ.0000000000000302"
"Background: Increases in hospital volume are positively associated with improved surgical outcomes. However, in the trauma setting, studies have reported conflicting findings in regard to volume's effect on in-hospital mortality. This study investigates whether complications, failure-to-rescue (FTR), and mortality are influenced by trauma centers' average annual volume. Methods: We performed a retrospective cohort study that analyzed patient records included in the National Trauma Data Bank from years 2008-2010. We calculated risk-adjusted complication, FTR, and mortality rates for centers treating different volumes of patients. We also performed multilevel logistic regression modeling to examine the probability that patients treated at trauma centers with higher annual volumes would experience complication, FTR, and mortality while controlling for injury severity, type of injury, mechanism of trauma, age, gender, race, number of comorbidities, head injury, hypotension, and hospital clustering. Hospital characteristics including designation level, academic status, nonprofit status, safety-net status, and region were incorporated into the model. Results: Risk-adjusted complication, FTR, and mortality rates differed significantly across hospital volume quintiles. Regression analyses indicated that higher hospital volumes were significantly associated with a decreased likelihood of mortality for individual patient but not for complication or FTR. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that higher trauma center volume is associated with improved mortality outcomes. However, the relationship between volume and FTR is more complex. Future research should address the question of determining optimal volume levels that lead to high provider experience, efficient resource usage, and low unintended consequences or outcomes.

"BackgroundAttention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) frequently co-occurs with externalizing disorders, but a clear understanding of the etiologic underpinnings is hampered by the limited understanding of the codevelopment of the traits from childhood into early adulthood. MethodsUsing a birth cohort of 2600 twins, the Swedish Twin study of Child and Adolescent Development study, assessed at ages 8-9, 13-14, 16-17, and 19-20, we investigated the codevelopment of ADHD and externalizing behavior from childhood to adulthood. The analyses examined ADHD-like and externalizing traits, as rated by twins and their parents using the Attention Problems scale and Externalizing scale of the Child Behavior Checklist, and estimated cross-lagged effects (one trait at one time-point predicting the other at the next). The covariation between the traits were decomposed into stable (effects carried over from the prior time-points) and innovative (new effects for each time-point) sources; each source was further decomposed into additive genetics, shared and nonshared environment. ResultsThe analysis suggested that externalizing traits in middle childhood (age 8-9) predicted ADHD-like traits in early adolescence (age 13-14), whereas the reverse association was nonsignificant. In contrast, ADHD-like traits in lateadolescence (age 16-17) predicted externalizing traits in early adulthood (age 19-20). The correlation between ADHD-like and externalizing traits increased over time. At all time-points, innovative sources contributed substantially to maintained comorbidity. Genetic effects explained 67% of the covariation at each time-point; importantly, nearly 50% of these effects were innovative. ConclusionsThis study challenges the belief that ADHD generally precedes externalizing behaviors; rather, change in the etiologic factors across the development is the rule. The effects were due to both new genetic and environmental factors emerging up to young adulthood. Clinicians and researchers needs to consider complex etiologic and developmental models for the comorbidity between ADHD and externalizing behaviors.",,,"D'Onofrio, BM|Kuja-Halkola, R|Larsson, H|Lichtenstein, P","D'Onofrio, Brian M.|Kuja-Halkola, Ralf|Larsson, Henrik|Lichtenstein, Paul",640,-1,,,,,,,-1,,-1,,,,,,,,Article,10.1111/jcpp.12340,,,,647,Clarivate Analytics Web of Science,,,,,,0021-9630,6,,,JOURNAL OF CHILD PSYCHOLOGY AND PSYCHIATRY,,,,ATTENTION-DEFICIT/HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER|DEFICIT-HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER|OPPOSITIONAL DEFIANT DISORDER|CONDUCT DISORDER|ENVIRONMENTAL-INFLUENCES|FOLLOW-UP|ADOLESCENT DEVELOPMENT|PSYCHIATRIC-DISORDERS|DEVELOPMENTAL TWIN|GENETIC INNOVATION,-1,"Kuja-Halkola, Ralf/0000-0002-3765-2067; lichtenstein, paul/0000-0003-3037-5287",ADHD|antisocial behavior|longitudinal studies|comorbidity|genetics|behavioral,,JUN,J,2015,,,,,,"Psychology, Developmental|Psychiatry|Psychology",,-1,,Psychology; Psychiatry,,3,Codevelopment of ADHD and externalizing behavior from childhood to adulthood,3,,WOS:000354464300005,1,56,1469-7610,25303006,C:\Users\mginda\Desktop\agc1\wos-extract.isi,"Kuja-Halkola R, 2015, V56, P640, DOI 10.1111/jcpp.12340"
"Background: The United States hospital safety net is defined by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality as the top decile of hospitals, which see the greatest proportion of uninsured patients. These hospitals provide important access to health care for uninsured patients but are commonly believed to have worse outcomes. The aim of this study was to compare the outcomes of emergency general surgery procedures performed at safety net and nonsafety net hospitals. Material and methods: The Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project Nationwide Inpatient Sample from 2008-2010 was used to create a cohort of inpatients who underwent emergency appendectomy, cholecystectomy, or herniorrhaphy. Outcomes measured included length of stay, charge, cost, death in hospital, complications, and failure to rescue (FTR). Univariate and logistic regression analysis was performed to associate variables with outcomes. Results: A total of 187,913 emergency general surgery cases were identified, 11.5% of which were performed at safety net hospitals. The safety net cohort had increased length of stay but lower mean charge and cost. Age, comorbidity score, black race, male gender, and Medicaid and Medicare insurance were associated with mortality, complication, and FTR. Lower socioeconomic status was associated with mortality and complication. Safety net status was positively associated with complication but not mortality or FTR. Conclusions: Safety net hospitals had higher complication rates but no difference in FTR or mortality. This may mean that the hospitals are able to effectively recognize and treat patient complications and do so without increased cost. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

"Objectives. We examined whether a sexually transmitted disease (STD) clinic could reach women who had not received a Papanicolau (Pap) test in the past 3 years. We also explored staff attitudes and implementation of cervical cancer screening. Methods. Women (n = 123) aged 30 to 50 years were offered cervical cancer screening in an Indiana STD clinic. We measured effectiveness by the patients' self-reported last Pap test. We explored adoption of screening through focus groups with 34 staff members by documenting their attitudes about cervical cancer screening and screening strategy adaptation. We also documented recruitment and screening implementation. Results. Almost half (47.9%) of participants reported a last Pap test 3 or more years previously; 30% had reported a last Pap more than 5 years ago, and 11.4% had a high-risk test outcome that required referral to colposcopy. Staff supported screening because of mission alignment and perceived patient benefit. Screening adaptations included eligibility, results provision, and follow-up. Conclusions.

"BackgroundThe influence of previous alcohol (ethanol [EtOH])-drinking experience on increasing the rate and amount of future EtOH consumption might be a genetically regulated phenomenon critical to the development and maintenance of repeated excessive EtOH abuse. We have recently found evidence supporting this view, wherein inbred C57BL/6J (B6) mice develop progressive increases in the rate of binge EtOH consumption over repeated drinking-in-the-dark (DID) EtOH access sessions (i.e., front loading). The primary goal of this study was to evaluate identical parameters in high-alcohol-preferring (HAP) mice to determine whether similar temporal alterations in limited-access EtOH drinking develop in a population selected for high EtOH preference/intake under continuous (24-hour) access conditions. MethodsUsing specialized volumetric drinking devices, HAP mice received 14 daily 2-hour DID EtOH or water access sessions. A subset of these mice was then given 1day access to the opposite assigned fluid on day 15. Home cage locomotor activity was recorded concomitantly on each day of these studies. The possibility of behavioral/metabolic tolerance was evaluated on day 16 using experimenter-administered EtOH. ResultsThe amount of EtOH consumed within the first 15minutes of access increased markedly over days. However, in contrast to previous observations in B6 mice, EtOH front loading was also observed on day 15 in mice that only had previous DID experience with water. Furthermore, a decrease in the amount of water consumed within the first 15minutes of access compared to animals given repeated water access was observed on day 15 in mice with 14 previous days of EtOH access. ConclusionsThese data further illustrate the complexity and importance of the temporal aspects of limited-access EtOH consumption and suggest that previous procedural/fluid experience in HAP mice selectively alters the time course of EtOH and water consumption.",,,"Boehm, SL|Linsenbardt, DN","Boehm, Stephen L., II|Linsenbardt, David N.",621,-1,,,,,,,-1,,-1,,,,,,,,Article,10.1111/acer.12679,,,,630,Clarivate Analytics Web of Science,,,,,,0145-6008,4,,,ALCOHOLISM-CLINICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL RESEARCH,,,,INBRED MOUSE STRAINS|CONDITIONED TASTE-AVERSION|BINGE DRINKING|LOCOMOTOR SENSITIZATION|PLACE PREFERENCE|CONSUMPTION|TOLERANCE|C57BL/6J|DBA/2J|GENE,-1,,Rate of Alcohol|Ethanol Intake|High-Alcohol-|Ethanol-Preferring Mice|Genetic Regulation of Binge Alcohol|Ethanol Consumption|Drinking-in-the-Dark|Novelty of Alcohol|Ethanol Access|Alcohol|Ethanol Front Loading,,APR,J,2015,,,,,,Substance Abuse,,-1,,Substance Abuse,,1,Relative Fluid Novelty Differentially Alters the Time Course of Limited-Access Ethanol and Water Intake in Selectively Bred High-Alcohol-Preferring Mice,1,,WOS:000352625800013,1,39,1530-0277,25833024,C:\Users\mginda\Desktop\agc1\wos-extract.isi,"Linsenbardt DN, 2015, V39, P621, DOI 10.1111/acer.12679"
"BackgroundStudies have found an association between low birth weight and ADHD, but the nature of this relation is unclear. First, it is uncertain whether birth weight is associated with both of the ADHD dimensions, inattentiveness and hyperactivity-impulsivity. Second, it remains uncertain whether the association between birth weight and ADHD symptom severity is confounded by familial factors. MethodParents of all Swedish 9- and 12-year-old twins born between 1992 and 2000 were interviewed for DSM-IV inattentive and hyperactive-impulsive ADHD symptoms by the Autism - Tics, AD/HD and other Comorbidities (A-TAC) inventory (N=21,775 twins). Birth weight was collected prospectively through the Medical Birth Registry. We used a within-twin pair design to control for genetic and shared environmental factors. ResultsReduced birth weight was significantly associated with a mean increase in total ADHD ( = -.42; 95% CI: -.53, -.30), inattentive ( = -.26; 95% CI: -.33, -.19), and hyperactive-impulsive ( = -.16; 95% CI: -.22, -.10) symptom severity. These results imply that a change of one kilogram of birth weight corresponded to parents rating their child nearly one unit higher (going from no to yes, to some extent on a given symptom) on the total ADHD scale. These associations remained within pairs of MZ and DZ twins, and were also present when restricting the analyses to full term births. ConclusionsThere is an independent association between low birth weight and all forms of ADHD symptoms, even after controlling for all environmental and genetic confounds shared within twin pairs. These results indicate that fetal growth restriction (as reflected in birth weight differences within twin pairs) and/or the environmental factors which influence it is in the casual pathway leading to ADHD.",,,"Almqvist, C|Anckarsater, H|D'Onofrio, BM|Larsson, H|Lichtenstein, P|Pettersson, E|Sjolander, A","Almqvist, Catarina|Anckarsater, Henrik|D'Onofrio, Brian M.|Larsson, Henrik|Lichtenstein, Paul|Pettersson, Erik|Sjolander, Arvid",453,-1,,,,,,,-1,,-1,,,,,,,,Article,10.1111/jcpp.12299,,,,459,Clarivate Analytics Web of Science,,,,,,0021-9630,4,,,JOURNAL OF CHILD PSYCHOLOGY AND PSYCHIATRY,,,,ATTENTION-DEFICIT/HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER|DEFICIT HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER|TELEPHONE INTERVIEW|BEHAVIORAL OUTCOMES|MONOZYGOTIC TWINS|CAUSAL INFERENCE|AUTISM-TICS|A-TAC|CHILDHOOD|CHILDREN,-1,,ADHD|DSM|birth weight|behavioral genetics|environmental influences,,APR,J,2015,,,,,,"Psychology, Developmental|Psychiatry|Psychology",,-1,,Psychology; Psychiatry,,30,Birth weight as an independent predictor of ADHD symptoms: a within-twin pair analysis,31,,WOS:000351402400007,1,56,1469-7610,25040291,C:\Users\mginda\Desktop\agc1\wos-extract.isi,"Pettersson E, 2015, V56, P453, DOI 10.1111/jcpp.12299"
"Better understanding risk factors for the development of adolescent emotional and behavioral problems can help with intervention and prevention efforts. Previous studies have found that an early menarcheal age predicts several adolescent problems, including depressive symptoms, delinquency, and early age at first intercourse. Few studies, nevertheless, have explicitly tested (a) whether the associations with menarcheal age vary across racial/ethnic groups or (b) whether the sources of the associations are within-families (i.e., consistent with a direct, causal link) or only between-families (i.e., due to selection or confounding factors). The current study analyzed data from a nationally representative US Sample of females (N = 5,637). We examined whether race/ethnicity moderated the associations between early menarche and several adolescent problems by using multiple-group analyses and we examined the degree to which genetic and environmental factors shared by family members account for the associations by comparing sisters and cousins with differing menarcheal ages. Menarcheal age predicted subsequent depressive symptoms, delinquency, and early age at first intercourse in the population. The magnitudes of the associations were similar across all racial/ethnic groups for all outcomes. The within-family associations (i.e., when comparing siblings and cousins with different menarcheal age) were large and statistically significant when predicting early intercourse, but not the other outcomes. The findings suggest that selection or confounding factors account for the associations between menarcheal age and subsequent depressive symptoms and delinquency, whereas the independent association between menarcheal age and early age at first intercourse is consistent with a direct, causal effect.",,,"Beasley, WH|D'Onofrio, BM|Rodgers, JL|Van Hulle, CA|Vaughan, EB","Beasley, William H.|D'Onofrio, Brian M.|Rodgers, Joseph L|Van Hulle, Carol A.|Vaughan, Erikka B.",922,-1,,,,,,,-1,,-1,,,,,,,,Article,10.1007/s10964-015-0255-7,,,,939,Clarivate Analytics Web of Science,,,,,,0047-2891,4,,,JOURNAL OF YOUTH AND ADOLESCENCE,,,,DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS|INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES|PUBERTAL DEVELOPMENT|SEXUAL-BEHAVIOR|ENVIRONMENTAL-INFLUENCES|REPRODUCTIVE STRATEGY|SOCIOECONOMIC-STATUS|CONDUCT DISORDER|YOUNG-ADULTS|RISK-TAKING,-1,,Age at menarche|Internalizing|Externalizing|Mechanisms,,APR,J,2015,,,,,,"Psychology, Developmental",,-1,SI,Psychology,,7,Clarifying the Associations between Age at Menarche and Adolescent Emotional and Behavioral Problems,7,,WOS:000351295400011,1,44,1573-6601,25687264,C:\Users\mginda\Desktop\agc1\wos-extract.isi,"Vaughan EB, 2015, V44, P922, DOI 10.1007/s10964-015-0255-7"
"This article reports on a longitudinal test of a developmental model of early smoking that specifies reciprocal predictive relationships between smoking expectancies and smoking behavior in youth. The model was tested on 1,906 children during the transition from elementary school to middle school across 3 time points: the spring of 5th grade, the fall of 6th grade, and the spring of 6th grade. Key findings were (a) elementary school expectancies for reinforcement from smoking predicted smoking behavior during middle school; (b) smoking experience predicted increased subsequent smoking expectancies; and (c) among children who had never smoked, smoking expectancies predicted subsequent smoking onset.

"Smoking is a preventable behavior that contributes to substantial loss of life and productivity. Although a growing amount of literature examines smoking among Asian American adolescents, there is a paucity of research investigating experiences that may contribute to smoking among Asian American adults. The purpose of this study is to investigate the links between life transitions and current smoking status among Asian American adults. A sample of Asian Americans was drawn from the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC) data set collected in 2001-2002 (Grant & Dawson, 2006). Results from logistic regressions indicate that after controlling for sex, age, income, proportion of life in the U.S., and ethnicity, life transitions in the past 12 months (i.e., interpersonal difficulties, death or illness of important other, divorce or separation, unemployment and occupational transitions) were found to be associated with increased odds of current smoking.

"People living in densely populated and socially disorganized areas have higher rates of psychiatric morbidity, but the potential causal status of such factors is uncertain. We used nationwide Swedish longitudinal registry data to identify all children born 1967-1989 (n = 2361585), including separate datasets for all cousins (n = 1715059) and siblings (n = 1667894). The nature of the associations between population density and neighborhood deprivation and individual risk for a schizophrenia diagnosis was investigated while adjusting for unobserved familial risk factors (through cousin and sibling comparisons) and then compared with similar associations for depression. We generated familial pedigree structures using the Multi-Generation Registry and identified study participants with schizophrenia and depression using the National Patient Registry. Fixed-effects logistic regression models were used to study within-family estimates. Population density, measured as ln(population size/km(2)), at age 15 predicted subsequent schizophrenia in the population (OR = 1.10; 95% CI: 1.09; 1.11). Unobserved familial risk factors shared by cousins within extended families attenuated the association (1.06; 1.03; 1.10), and the link disappeared entirely within nuclear families (1.02; 0.97; 1.08). Similar results were found for neighborhood deprivation as predictor and for depression as outcome. Sensitivity tests demonstrated that timing and accumulation effects of the exposures (mean scores across birth, ages 1-5, 6-10, and 11-15 years) did not alter the findings. Excess risks of psychiatric morbidity, particularly schizophrenia, in densely populated and socioeconomically deprived Swedish neighborhoods appear, therefore, to result primarily from unobserved familial selection factors.

"ObjectiveThe very early engagement in bulimic behaviors, such as binge eating, may be influenced by factors that dispose individuals to impulsive action as well as by factors that dispose individuals to depressive symptomatology. Using a longitudinal design, we conducted the first test of the simultaneous operation of both risk factors as children transition from elementary to middle school. MethodIn a sample of 1,906 children, we assessed risk for impulsive action (negative urgency, which is the tendency to act rashly when distressed, and eating expectancies, which are learned anticipations that eating will alleviate negative mood) and risk for depression (negative affect and depressive symptomatology) and binge eating behavior at three time points using a longitudinal design: the end of fifth grade (last year of elementary school: T0), the beginning of sixth grade (first year of middle school: T1), and the end of sixth grade (T2). ResultsBoth the impulsive action and depression pathways predicted very early engagement in binge eating: each accounted for variance beyond the other. Mediation tests found that T1 eating expectancies mediated the predictive influence of T0 negative urgency on T2 binge eating (z=2.45, p<.01) and that T1 depressive symptoms mediated the influence of T0 negative affect on T2 binge eating (z=2.04, p<.05). DiscussionIn children, elevated levels of both negative urgency and negative affect predict early binge eating. This finding has important clinical implications because there are different interventions for the two different risk processes. (c) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

"The GABA(B) receptor agonist baclofen has been studied extensively in preclinical models of alcohol-use disorders, yet results on its efficacy have been uncertain. Racemic baclofen, which is used clinically, can be broken down into separate enantiomers of the drug. Baclofen has been shown to produce enantioselective effects in behavioral assays, including those modeling reflexive and sexual behavior. The current studies sought to characterize the enantioselective effects of baclofen in two separate models of ethanol consumption. The first was a Drinking-in-the-Dark procedure that provides ""binge-like"" ethanol access to mice by restricting access to a 2-h period, 3 h into the dark cycle. The second was a two-bottle choice procedure that utilized selectively bred High Alcohol Preferring 1 (HAP1) mice to model chronic ethanol access. HAP1 mice are selectively bred to consume pharmacologically relevant amounts of ethanol in a 24-h two-bottle choice paradigm. The results showed that baclofen yields enantioselective effects on ethanol intake in both models, and that these effects are bidirectional. Total ethanol intake was decreased by R(+)-baclofen, while total intake was increased by S(-)-baclofen in the binge-like and chronic drinking models. Whereas overall binge-like saccharin intake was significantly reduced by R(+)-baclofen, chronic intake was not significantly altered. S(-)-baclofen did not significantly alter saccharin intake. Neither enantiomer significantly affected locomotion during binge-like reinforcer consumption. Collectively, these results demonstrate that baclofen produces enantioselective effects on ethanol consumption. More importantly, the modulation of consumption is bidirectional. The opposing enantioselective effects may explain some of the variance seen in published baclofen literature. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

"BACKGROUND: Death after complication or ""failure to rescue"" (FTR) contributes to differences in risk-adjusted mortality rates among trauma centers and is considered an indicator of quality of care. Successful management of trauma patients requires not only appropriately responding to complications but also timely recognition of adverse events. Identifying associations between patient characteristics, such as the presence of comorbidities, and FTR outcomes can potentially improve early detection of complications and can reduce the risk of in-hospital mortality. METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study that analyzed patient records included in the National Trauma Data Bank from years 2008 to 2010. Cox regression modeling was used to determine the contribution of individual comorbidities to FTR outcomes while controlling for confounding variables. RESULTS: Diabetes, congestive heart failure, history of myocardial infarction, and dialysis were associated with greater hazard ratios (HRs) (95% confidence interval [CI]) for FTR (1.19 [1.05-1.35], 1.63 [1.30-2.05], 1.40 [1.08-1.81], 2.34 [1.72-3.19], respectively). Smoking, alcoholism, and respiratory disease were associated with a lower risk of FTR (HR [95% CI], 0.68 [0.60-0.77]; 0.88 [0.80-0.98]; and 0.77 [0.66-0.91], respectively). Obesity and hypertension were not associated with increased risk of FTR. CONCLUSION: Preexisting comorbidities contributed significantly to risk of death after complication in the trauma population. Identifying processes of care that lead to better management of complications in patients with comorbidities would improve trauma centers' overall mortality outcomes.

"The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between parental vaccine attitudes, the number of specific vaccines discussed with a provider, and immunization outcomes including discussing immunization with their teen, knowledge of adolescent vaccine schedule, and their son or daughter being up-to-date on recommended vaccines using a nationally weight sample. Parents completed an internet-based survey between December 2012 and January 2013 and we computed a vaccine attitude scale (higher scores indicating stronger and more positive attitudes toward vaccination of teen) for each parent and categorized them into one of three groups: low (n = 76), medium (n = 207) or high (n = 215). We also constructed a vaccine discussion scale representing the number of vaccines discussed with their adolescent's physician. Parents who were identified as having high vaccine attitudes were significantly more likely to report their physician talked with them about a particular vaccine. Using logistic regression and controlling for respondent's gender and age, income, and teen's gender, we found medium as compared to low-attitude parents had a 6.21 (95%CI = 3.08, 12.51) greater odds of reporting that their teen had all recommended vaccines. Similarly, high as compared to low-attitude parents reported a 23.02 (95%CI = 11.27, 46.99) greater odds of having a teen who was up-to-date on recommended vaccines. We detected that for each additional vaccine discussed, there was a 1.24 (95%CI = 1.11, 1.39) increase in odds of the teen having all recommended vaccines. Parental immunization attitudes and provider discussion about vaccines are key ingredients to improving immunization rates among adolescents. While some parents may be reluctant to immunize their son or daughter with a recommended vaccine, vaccine-specific discussions between physicians and parents represent an important first step to continued discussions with providers regarding vaccination. Moreover, vaccine discussions must occur within the context of ongoing conversations about health and disease prevention. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

"Well-being has been mandated by the Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997 as one of the three major goals of the child welfare system. Assessment of well-being includes the following domains: education, physical and developmental disabilities, mental and emotional health, and physical health. The current study examines the interaction of race, availability of resources, and placement frequency on child wellbeing utilizing administrative data from a state child welfare agency. A three-way Analysis of Covariance was used to assess interactions among resource availability, race, and placement frequency, controlling for age and gender. A significant three-way interaction demonstrated differences among White and non-White families' resource availability and placement frequency. In order to assess the risk attributable to each predictor, follow-up analysis was conducted using binary logistic regression. Resource availability presented the greatest odds of positive well-being outcomes. Adequate resource availability and placement frequency increased the odds of positive well-being.",,,"Aalsma, MC|Hall, JA|Jaggers, JW|Richardson, EA","Aalsma, Matthew C.|Hall, James A.|Jaggers, Jeremiah W.|Richardson, Eprise Armstrong",105,-1,,,,,,,-1,,-1,,,,,,,,Article,,,,,128,Clarivate Analytics Web of Science,,,,,,0009-4021,6,,,CHILD WELFARE,,,,FOSTER-CARE|INCOME INEQUALITY|WELFARE OUTCOMES|UNITED-STATES|RISK-FACTORS|MALTREATMENT|STABILITY|HEALTH|FAMILY|IMPACT,-1,,,,,J,2015,,,,,,Family Studies|Social Work,,-1,,Family Studies; Social Work,,0,"Resources, Race, and Placement Frequency: An Analysis of Child Well-Being",0,,WOS:000407980800006,1,94,,,C:\Users\mginda\Desktop\agc1\wos-extract.isi,"Jaggers JW, 2015, V94, P105"

"This study investigates gender differences within the context of risk and protective factors for alcohol use and substance use problems in a sample of 8,992 Hispanic students in grades 6 through 12, who responded to a statewide survey of alcohol and other drug use. The effects of gender, grade, and risk and protective factors on past-month alcohol use, binge drinking, and risk for substance use problems are examined. Results show that outcomes were moderated by gender, such that females had greater predicted probabilities than males for alcohol use, binge drinking, and risk for substance use problems across levels of risk and protective factors. An ecological framework is applied to speculate why Hispanic female adolescents were more vulnerable than their males to problem alcohol use.",,,"de Martinez, BJS|Gassman, RA|Jun, MC|Vaughan, EL","de Martinez, Barbara J.

"In the US, the new subspecialty of Clinical Informatics focuses on systems-level improvements in care delivery through the use of health information technology (HIT), data analytics, clinical decision support, data visualization and related tools. Clinical informatics is one of the first subspecialties in medicine open to physicians trained in any primary specialty. Clinical Informatics benefits patients and payers such as Medicare and Medicaid through its potential to reduce errors, increase safety, reduce costs, and improve care coordination and efficiency. Even though Clinical Informatics benefits patients and payers, because GME funding from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) has not grown at the same rate as training programs, the majority of the cost of training new Clinical Informaticians is currently paid by academic health science centers, which is unsustainable. To maintain the value of HIT investments by the government and health care organizations, we must train sufficient leaders in Clinical Informatics. In the best interest of patients, payers, and the US society, it is therefore critical to find viable financial models for Clinical Informatics fellowship programs. To support the development of adequate training programs in Clinical Informatics, we request that the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) issue clarifying guidance that would allow accredited ACGME institutions to bill for clinical services delivered by fellows at the fellowship program site within their primary specialty.",,"Lehmann, Christoph/M-1845-2016","Embi, PJ|Finnell, JT|Hersh, WR|Lehmann, CU|Levy, BP|Longhurst, CA|Martin, R|Mohan, V|Munger, B|Turner, AM|Williamson, J","Embi, Peter J.|Finnell, J.

"Objectives. We assessed routine HIV testing in Indiana community health centers (CHCs). Methods. CHC medical directors reported HIV services, testing behaviors, barriers, and health center characteristics via survey from April to May 2013. Standard of care testing was measured by the extent to which CHCs complied with national guidelines for routine HIV testing in clinical settings. Results. Most (85.7%) CHCs reported HIV testing, primarily at patient request or if the patient was symptomatic. Routine HIV testing was provided for pregnant women by 60.7% of CHCs. Only 10.7% provided routine testing for adolescents to adults up to age 65 years. Routine testing was reported by 14.3% for gay and bisexual men, although 46.4% of CHCs reported asking patients about sexual orientation. Linkage to care services for HIV-positive patients, counseling for HIV treatment adherence, and partner testing generally was not provided. Conclusions. Most CHCs reported HIV testing, but such testing did not reflect the standard of care, because it depended on patient request or symptoms. One approach in future studies may be to allow respondents to compare current testing with standard of care and then reflect on barriers to and facilitators of adoption and implementation of routine HIV testing.",,,"Gillespie, A|Meyerson, BE|Navale, SM|Ohmit, A","Gillespie, Anthony|Meyerson, Beth E.|Navale, Shalini M.|Ohmit, Anita",91,-1,,,,,,,-1,,-1,,,,,,,,Article,10.2105/AJPH.2014.302203,,,,95,Clarivate Analytics Web of Science,,,,,,0090-0036,1,,,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH,,,,CENTER PERSONNEL|BARRIERS|STATES|CARE|PREVALENCE|ADULTS,-1,,,,JAN,J,2015,,,,,,"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health",,-1,,"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health",,3,Routine HIV Testing in Indiana Community Health Centers,3,,WOS:000351920100032,1,105,1541-0048,25393186,C:\Users\mginda\Desktop\agc1\wos-extract.isi,"Meyerson BE, 2015, V105, P91, DOI 10.2105/AJPH.2014.302203"
"A powerful longitudinal data source, the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth Children data, allows measurement of behavior problems (BP) within a developmental perspective linking them to menarcheal timing (MT). In a preliminary analysis, we evaluate the bivariate relationships between BP measured at different developmental periods and the timing of menarche. Correlations were not consistent with any correlational/causal relationship between BP and MT. In the major part of our study, MT was used to moderate the developmental trajectory of BP, within a genetically-informed design. Girls reaching menarche early had behavior problem variance accounted for by the shared environment; those reaching menarche with average/late timing had behavior problem differences accounted for by genetic variance. Our findings match previous empirical results in important ways, and also extend those results. A theoretical interpretation is offered in relation to a theory linking genetic/shared environmental variance to flexibility and choices available within the family in relation to BP.",,,"Beasley, WH|D'Onofrio, BM|Johnson, A|Lahey, BB|Rathouz, PJ|Rodgers, JL|Van Hulle, CA|Waldman, ID","Beasley, William H.|D'Onofrio, Brian M.|Johnson, Amber|Lahey, Benjamin B.|Rathouz, Paul J.|Rodgers, Joseph L|Van Hulle, Carol A.|Waldman, Irwin D.",51,-1,,,,,,,-1,,-1,,,,,,,,Article,10.1007/s10519-014-9676-4,,,,70,Clarivate Analytics Web of Science,,,,,,0001-8244,1,,,BEHAVIOR GENETICS,,,,MULTIPLE-REGRESSION ANALYSIS|ADOLESCENT SEXUAL-BEHAVIOR|GENE-ENVIRONMENT INTERPLAY|LIKELIHOOD RATIO TESTS|ANDROGEN RECEPTOR GENE|ANTISOCIAL-BEHAVIOR|TWIN DATA|FATHER ABSENCE|DF ANALYSIS|DIFFERENTIAL SUSCEPTIBILITY,-1,,Behavior problems|Conduct disorder|Timing of menarche|Cholesky models|Moderation|NLSY-Children data,,JAN,J,2015,,,,,,"Behavioral Sciences|Genetics & Heredity|Psychology, Multidisciplinary",,-1,,Behavioral Sciences; Genetics & Heredity; Psychology,,3,Behavior Problems and Timing of Menarche: A Developmental Longitudinal Biometrical Analysis Using the NLSY-Children Data,3,,WOS:000348279200005,1,45,1573-3297,25246040,C:\Users\mginda\Desktop\agc1\wos-extract.isi,"Rodgers JL, 2015, V45, P51, DOI 10.1007/s10519-014-9676-4"

"Background: Individuals entering jails have high rates of sexually transmitted infections (STI), but there are few data on STI in the post-incarceration period. This study aimed to describe rates of chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis infection among individuals released from Marion County (Indianapolis), Indiana jails. Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of individuals incarcerated in Marion County, Indiana jails from 2003 to 2008 (n = 118,670). We linked county jail and public health data to identify individuals with positive STI test results in the 1 year after release from jail. Rates per 100,000 individuals and Cox proportional hazard analyses were performed for each STI, stratified by demographic, STI, and jail characteristics. Results: We found significantly higher rates of STI in this cohort than in the general population, with rates in the 1 year after release being 2 to 7 times higher for chlamydia, 5 to 24 times higher for gonorrhea, and 19 to 32 times higher for syphilis compared with rates in the general population. Characteristics most associated with increased risk of a positive STI test result among this cohort were younger age for chlamydia and gonorrhea, older age for syphilis, black race for men, being jailed for prostitution for women, history of STI, and history of prior incarceration. Conclusions: This study found high rates of STIs among a cohort of individuals recently released from jail and identified a number of risk factors. Further study is needed to improve targeted STI testing and treatment among this high-risk population.",,"Wiehe, Sarah/R-6083-2017","Aalsma, MC|Barai, N|Fortenberry, JD|Rosenman, MB|Scanlon, ML|Wiehe, SE","Aalsma, Matthew C.|Barai, Nikita|Fortenberry, J.

"Little is known about the experience of professional burnout among juvenile probation officers. Following a statewide survey, 26 officers were randomly selected for qualitative interviews. Using emergent, consensus-based methods, we identified key aspects of the burnout experience. Officers described burnout in ways consistent with research definitions. Most probation officers identified negative effects of burnout, including spending less time getting to know the clients and becoming more directive. Probation officers tended to have limited strategies for managing burnout. Given the important role probation officers play in the lives of juvenile justice involved youth, more work is needed to help ameliorate burnout.",,,"Aalsma, MC|Alexander, AO|Hood, BJ|Salyers, MP|Schwartz, K","Aalsma, Matthew C.|Alexander, Andrew O.|Hood, Brittany|Salyers, Michelle P.|Schwartz, Katherine",175,-1,,,,,,,-1,,-1,,,,,,,,Article,10.1080/10509674.2015.1009967,,,,193,Clarivate Analytics Web of Science,,,,,,1050-9674,3,,,JOURNAL OF OFFENDER REHABILITATION,,,,JOB BURNOUT|EMOTIONAL LABOR|CORRECTIONAL STAFF|SOCIAL SUPPORT|STRESS|CONSERVATION|STRATEGIES|RESOURCES|PAROLE|MODEL,-1,,delinquents|juvenile offenders|probation outcomes|qualitative research|support systems,,,J,2015,,,,,,Social Work,,-1,,Social Work,,6,"The Experience, Impact, and Management of Professional Burnout Among Probation Officers in Juvenile Justice Settings",6,,WOS:000211285600002,1,54,1540-8558,,C:\Users\mginda\Desktop\agc1\wos-extract.isi,"Salyers MP, 2015, V54, P175, DOI 10.1080/10509674.2015.1009967"
"Background: Women who give birth at younger ages (e. g. teenage mothers) are more likely to have children who exhibit behaviour problems, such as attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). However, it is not clear whether young maternal age is causally associated with poor offspring outcomes or confounded by familial factors. Methods: The association between early maternal age at childbirth and offspring ADHD was studied using data from Swedish national registers. The sample included all children born in Sweden between 1988 and 2003 (N = 1 495 543), including 30 674 children with ADHD. We used sibling-and cousin-comparisons to control for unmeasured genetic and environmental confounding. Further, we used a children-of-siblings model to quantify the genetic and environmental contribution to the association between maternal age and offspring ADHD. Results: Maternal age at first birth (MAFB) was associated with offspring ADHD. Teenage childbirth (< 20 years) was associated with 78% increased risk of ADHD. The association attenuated in cousin-comparison, suggesting unmeasured familial confounding. The children-of-siblings model indicated that the association between MAFB and ADHD was mainly explained by genetic confounding. Conclusions: All children born to mothers who bore their first child early in their reproductive lives were at increased risk of ADHD. The association was mainly explained by genetic factors transmitted from mothers to their offspring that contribute to both age at childbirth and ADHD in offspring. Our results highlight the importance of using family-based designs to understand how early life circumstances affect child development.",,,"Almqvist, C|Chang, Z|D'Onofrio, BM|Kuja-Halkola, R|Larsson, H|Lichtenstein, P|Sjolander, A","Almqvist, Catarina|Chang, Zheng|D'Onofrio, Brian M.|Kuja-Halkola, Ralf|Larsson, Henrik|Lichtenstein, Paul|Sjolander, Arvid",1815,-1,,,,,,,-1,,-1,,,,,,,,Article,10.1093/ije/dyu204,,,,1824,Clarivate Analytics Web of Science,,,,,,0300-5771,6,,,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY,,,,DEFICIT-HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER|ATTENTION-DEFICIT/HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER|TEST CAUSAL HYPOTHESES|ENVIRONMENTAL-INFLUENCES|YOUNG MOTHERS|TWINS DESIGN|CHILDREN|METAANALYSIS|REGISTER|OUTCOMES,-1,"Kuja-Halkola, Ralf/0000-0002-3765-2067",ADHD|maternal age|family-based design,,DEC,J,2014,,,,,,"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health",,-1,,"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health",,24,Maternal age at childbirth and risk for ADHD in offspring: a population-based cohort study,24,,WOS:000348575500025,1,43,1464-3685,25355726,C:\Users\mginda\Desktop\agc1\wos-extract.isi,"Chang Z, 2014, V43, P1815, DOI 10.1093/ije/dyu204"

"Cross-institutional data sharing for cohort discovery is critical to enabling future research. While particularly useful in rare diseases, the ability to target enrollment and to determine if an institution has a sufficient number of patients is valuable in all research, particularly in the initiation of projects and collaborations. An optimal technology solution would work with any source database with minimal resource investment for deployment and would meet all necessary security and confidentiality requirements of participating organizations. We describe a platform-neutral reference implementation to meet these requirements: the Federated Aggregate Cohort Estimator (FACE). FACE was developed and implemented through a collaboration of The University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB), The Ohio State University (OSU), the University of Massachusetts Medical School (UMMS), and the Denver Health and Hospital Authority (DHHA) a clinical affiliate of the Colorado Clinical and Translational Sciences Institute. The reference implementation of FACE federated diverse SQL data sources and an i2b2 instance to estimate combined research subject availability from three institutions. It used easily-deployed virtual machines and addressed privacy and security concerns for data sharing. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

"We have previously shown that ethanol-naive high-alcohol preferring (HAP) mice, genetically predisposed to consume large quantities of alcohol, exhibited heightened sensitivity and more rapid acute functional tolerance (AFT) to alcohol-induced ataxia compared to low-alcohol preferring mice. The goal of the present study was to evaluate the effect of prior alcohol self-administration on these responses in HAP mice. Naive male and female adult HAP mice from the second replicate of selection (HAP2) underwent 18 days of 24-h, 2-bottle choice drinking for 10% ethanol vs. water, or water only. After 18 days of fluid access, mice were tested for ataxic sensitivity and rapid AFT following a 1.75 g/kg injection of ethanol on a static dowel apparatus in Experiment 1. In Experiment 2, a separate group of mice was tested for more protracted AFT development using a dual-injection approach where a second, larger (2.0 g/kg) injection of ethanol was given following the initial recovery of performance on the task. HAP2 mice that had prior access to alcohol exhibited a blunted ataxic response to the acute alcohol challenge, but this pre-exposure did not alter rapid within-session AFT capacity in Experiment 1 or more protracted AFT capacity in Experiment 2. These findings suggest that the typically observed increase in alcohol consumption in these mice may be influenced by ataxic functional tolerance development, but is not mediated by a greater capacity for ethanol exposure to positively influence within-session ataxic tolerance.

"Individual, social, and structural factors affecting HIV risk behaviors among female sex workers (FSWs) are difficult to assess using retrospective surveys methods. To test the feasibility and acceptability of cell phone diaries to collect information about sexual events, we recruited 26 FSWs in Indianapolis, Indiana (US). Over 4 weeks, FSWs completed twice daily digital diaries about their mood, drug use, sexual interactions, and daily activities. Feasibility was assessed using repeated measures general linear modeling and descriptive statistics examined event-level contextual information and acceptability. Of 1,420 diaries expected, 90.3 % were completed by participants and compliance was stable over time (p > .05 for linear trend). Sexual behavior was captured in 22 % of diaries and participant satisfaction with diary data collection was high. These data provide insight into event-level factors impacting HIV risk among FSWs. We discuss implications for models of sexual behavior and individually tailored interventions to prevent HIV in this high-risk group.",,"Wiehe, Sarah/R-6083-2017","Fortenberry, JD|Garfein, RS|Gunn, JKL|Hensel, DJ|Roth, AM|Wiehe, SE","Fortenberry, J.

"Background It is unclear whether associations between fetal growth and psychiatric and socioeconomic problems are consistent with causal mechanisms. Aims To estimate the extent to which associations are a result of unmeasured confounding factors using a sibling-comparison approach. Method We predicted outcomes from continuously measured birth weight in a Swedish population cohort (n=3291773), while controlling for measured and unmeasured confounding. Results In the population, lower birth weight (<= 2500g) increased the risk of all outcomes. Sibling-comparison models indicated that lower birth weight independently predicted increased risk for autism spectrum disorder (hazard ratio for low birth weight=2.44, 95% CI 1.99-2.97) and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder. Although attenuated, associations remained for psychotic or bipolar disorder and educational problems. Associations with suicide attempt, substance use problems and social welfare receipt, however, were fully attenuated in sibling comparisons. Conclusions Results suggest that fetal growth, and factors that influence it, contribute to psychiatric and socioeconomic problems.",,,"Class, QA|D'Onofrio, BM|Larsson, H|Lichtenstein, P|Rickert, ME","Class, Quetzal A.|D'Onofrio, Brian M.|Larsson, Henrik|Lichtenstein, Paul|Rickert, Martin",355,-1,,,,,,,-1,,-1,,,,,,,,Article,10.1192/bjp.bp.113.143693,,,,361,Clarivate Analytics Web of Science,,,,,,0007-1250,5,,,BRITISH JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRY,,,,LOW-BIRTH-WEIGHT|INTRAUTERINE GROWTH|MATERNAL SMOKING|ENVIRONMENTAL-INFLUENCES|BEHAVIORAL OUTCOMES|ATTENTION PROBLEMS|MONOZYGOTIC TWINS|BRAIN-DEVELOPMENT|YOUNG ADULTHOOD|GESTATIONAL-AGE,-1,"lichtenstein, paul/0000-0003-3037-5287; Larsson, Henrik/0000-0002-6851-3297",,,NOV,J,2014,,,,,,Psychiatry,,-1,,Psychiatry,,21,Fetal growth and psychiatric and socioeconomic problems: population-based sibling comparison,21,,WOS:000344973700004,1,205,1472-1465,25257067,C:\Users\mginda\Desktop\agc1\wos-extract.isi,"Class QA, 2014, V205, P355, DOI 10.1192/bjp.bp.113.143693"
"Purpose: To better understand how confidentiality impacts the delivery of preventive adolescent health care by examining adolescent and parent beliefs and the relationship between confidentiality and the number and subject matter of health topics discussed at the last visit. Methods: This study represents a secondary analysis of nationally representative online survey data collected from adolescents aged 13-17 years (N = 504) and parents of adolescents aged 13-17 years (N = 500). Descriptive statistics were conducted on confidentiality variables of interest. Analysis of variance and Scheffe post hoc tests were computed to determine whether the mean number of topics discussed varied by level of confidential consultation provided. Associations between confidential consultation and health topics discussed at the last visit were examined using multivariate logistic regression. Results: Approximately, half of both samples reported provision of confidential consultation. Eighty-nine percent of parents believed adolescents should be able to speak with providers alone, yet 61% preferred to be in examination room for the entire visit. Nearly half of all adolescents believed parental presence impacted conversation. Mean number of topics discussed was significantly higher when a visit was partially confidential (4.11 +/- 3.05; p = 0) versus when a visit was not confidential (2.76 +/- 2.68; p = 0). There were significant associations between confidential consultation and discussions about 8 of 11 health topics. Conclusions: Confidential consultation significantly impacts the number and subject matter of health topics discussed. A split-visit confidentiality model for adolescent preventive care visits may result in clinical conversations that address more topics. This arrangement may also appeal to parents who have mixed feelings about confidentiality. (C) 2014 Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine.

"Background: The role of community health centers (CHCs) in preventive health care is central to health reform, yet little is known about how CHCs identify and manage sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Methods: A survey of Indiana CHCs from April to May 2013 measured reported STI services, clinic expectations for STI testing and management, barriers to screening and management, and partner services. Reported practices were compared with current Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines for STI testing in clinical settings. Results: Although most CHCs reported screening for syphilis (75.0%), chlamydia, and gonorrhea (85.7%), screening generally did not reflect CDC guidelines. Chlamydia and gonorrhea testing was provided primarily at patient request or when symptomatic by 67.9% of CHCs. Syphilis testing at 67.9% of CHCs reflected CDC guidelines for adults 65 years or younger and at 53.6% for first-trimester pregnant women. Chlamydia and gonorrhea screening reflected CDC guidelines for 17.9% of CHCs for gay/bisexual men and 60.9% for first-trimester pregnant women. One-third (35%) of CHCs reported not knowing the expectation for screening pregnant women and gay/bisexual men. Conclusions: It is likely that CHCs are not aware of patient sexual health risks because standard of care screening was observed only for gonorrhea and chlamydia during the first trimester and for syphilis testing when symptoms were present. As CHCs increase their role in preventive care with the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, focus must be upon clinician awareness of patient sexual health and training to identify and manage STIs in their patient populations.",,,"Gillespie, A|Meyerson, BE|Navale, SM|Ohmit, A","Gillespie, Anthony|Meyerson, Beth E.|Navale, Shalini M.|Ohmit, Anita",684,-1,,,,,,,-1,,-1,,,,,,,,Article,10.1097/OLQ.0000000000000198,,,,689,Clarivate Analytics Web of Science,,,,,,0148-5717,11,,,SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED DISEASES,,,,,-1,,,,NOV,J,2014,,,,,,Infectious Diseases,,-1,,Infectious Diseases,,2,Understanding Sexually Transmitted Infection Screening and Management in Indiana Community Health Centers,2,,WOS:000344165300009,1,41,1537-4521,25299417,C:\Users\mginda\Desktop\agc1\wos-extract.isi,"Navale SM, 2014, V41, P684, DOI 10.1097/OLQ.0000000000000198"
"Associations among receptive vocabulary measured at 4-9 years, mother-reported childhood conduct problems at 4-9 years, and self-reported adolescent delinquency at 14-17 years were assessed using data from a prospective study of the offspring of a large U.S. nationally representative sample of women. A novel quasi-experimental strategy was used to rule out family-level confounding by estimating path-analytic associations within families in a sibling comparison design. This allowed simultaneous tests of the direct and indirect effects of receptive vocabulary and childhood conduct problems, and of their joint moderation, on adolescent delinquency without family-level environmental confounding. The significant association of receptive vocabulary with later adolescent delinquency was indirect, mediated by childhood conduct problems. Furthermore, a significant interaction between receptive vocabulary and childhood conduct problems reflected a steeper slope for the predictive association between childhood conduct problems and adolescent delinquency when receptive vocabulary scores were higher. These findings of significant indirect association were qualitatively identical in both population-level and within-family analyses, suggesting that they are not the result of family-level confounds.",,,"D'Onofrio, BM|Lahey, BB|Rathouz, PJ|Van Hulle, CA","D'Onofrio, Brian M.|Lahey, Benjamin B.|Rathouz, Paul J.|Van Hulle, Carol A.",1341,-1,,,,,,,-1,,-1,,,,,,,,Article,10.1007/s10802-014-9873-x,,,,1351,Clarivate Analytics Web of Science,,,,,,0091-0627,8,,,JOURNAL OF ABNORMAL CHILD PSYCHOLOGY,,,,ANTISOCIAL-BEHAVIOR|CHILDREN|IQ|YOUTH|INTELLIGENCE|HYPOTHESES|ANNOTATION|TAXONOMY,-1,,Receptive vocabulary|Childhood conduct problems|Adolescent delinquency|Sibling comparison analysis|Quasi-experimental designs,,NOV,J,2014,,,,,,"Psychology, Clinical|Psychology, Developmental",,-1,,Psychology,,2,Prospective Association of Childhood Receptive Vocabulary and Conduct Problems with Self-Reported Adolescent Delinquency: Tests of Mediation and Moderation in Sibling-Comparison Analyses,2,,WOS:000343819000008,1,42,1573-2835,24736982,C:\Users\mginda\Desktop\agc1\wos-extract.isi,"Lahey BB, 2014, V42, P1341, DOI 10.1007/s10802-014-9873-x"
"A paucity of research addresses the mental health needs of diverse groups of older adults. In particular, substance use among older adult Latinos represents an important but understudied area. The aim of this study was to test demographic, mental health, and physical health problems as predictors of alcohol use among Latino older adults. Secondary data analysis of the National Epidemiological Study of Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC; Grant & Dawson, 2006) was conducted to test proportion of life lived in the United States, mental health diagnosis, and physical health problems as predictors of alcohol use, binge drinking, and a lifetime alcohol use disorder. Participants self-identified as Hispanic or Latino and were aged 50 or older. Results found that males and those who had lived more of their lives in the United States had greater odds of recent alcohol use, binge drinking, and lifetime alcohol use disorder. Lifetime depression was associated with greater odds of all 3 alcohol use outcomes while lifetime anxiety disorder was associated with greater odds of binge drinking and lifetime alcohol use disorder. Health problems in the past year decreased the odds of past-year drinking and binge drinking. Implications for future research include testing potential mediators of the link between health problems and alcohol use. For example, perceptions that alcohol use may interfere with treatment and recovery might keep older adults with health problems from using alcohol. Overall, the results from this study underscore the importance of assessment of alcohol use and associated risks among diverse populations of older adults.",,,"Escobar, OS|Robbins, MJ|Vaughan, EL","Escobar, Oscar S.|Robbins, Melanie J.|Vaughan, Ellen L.",214,-1,,,,,,,-1,,-1,,,,,,,,Article,10.1037/lat0000026,,,,223,Clarivate Analytics Web of Science,,,,,,2168-1678,4,,,JOURNAL OF LATINA-O PSYCHOLOGY,,,,,-1,,older adults|Hispanic/Latino|alcohol|binge drinking,,NOV,J,2014,,,,,,"Psychology, Clinical|Psychology, Developmental|Psychology, Multidisciplinary|Psychology, Social",,-1,,Psychology,,4,"Mental Health, Physical Health Problems, and Drinking Among Latino Older Adults",4,,WOS:000440898600003,1,2,2163-0070,,C:\Users\mginda\Desktop\agc1\wos-extract.isi,"Vaughan EL, 2014, V2, P214, DOI 10.1037/lat0000026"
"Extrasynaptic GABA(A) receptors, often identified as those containing both alpha 4 and delta subunits, demonstrate super-sensitivity to GABA and are involved in tonic inhibitory processes regulating activity within mesolimbocortical circuitry. Rodent studies testing the effects of the delta-subunit selective agonist Gaboxadol (THIP) on alcohol consumption have produced mixed results. The goal of this study was to determine the role of extrasynaptic GABAA receptors located in the infralimbic cortex (ILC) in the alcohol consumption of male C57BL/6J (B6) mice. The ILC is of interest due to its demonstrated involvement in stress reactivity. Furthermore, alcohol exposure has been shown to interfere with extinction learning; impairments of which may be related to inflexible behavior (i.e., problematic alcohol consumption). Adult male B6 mice were bilaterally implanted with guide cannulas aimed at the ILC and were subsequently offered daily limited access to 20% ethanol or 5% sucrose for 7 days. Immediately prior to ethanol or sucrose access on day 7, mice were bilaterally injected with 50 or 100 ng THIP (25 or 50 ng per side respectively) or saline vehicle into the ILC. The highest dose of intra-ILC THIP (100 ng/mouse) increased alcohol intake relative to vehicle controls, although control animals consumed relatively little ethanol following infusion. Intra-ILC THIP had no effect on sucrose consumption (p>0.05), suggesting that the effect of THIP was selective for ethanol consumption. Together, these findings suggest that THIP may have effectively prevented the decrease in ethanol intake on day 7 induced by the microinjection process, perhaps supporting a suggested role for the ILC in adaptive learning processes and behavioral flexibility.

"We investigated reliability and validity of the Mediator's Assessment of Safety Issues and Concerns (MASIC), a screening interview for intimate partner violence and abuse (IPV/A) in family mediation settings. Clients at three family mediation clinics in the United States and Australia (N = 391) provided reports of the other parent's IPV/A. Internal consistency of the total screen was excellent. A confirmatory factor analysis provided evidence that the MASIC assesses seven types of IPV/A: psychological abuse, coercive controlling behaviors, threats of severe violence, physical violence, severe physical violence, sexual violence, and stalking. Sex differences on differing types of violence victimization were generally consistent with previous research. Higher levels of victimization predicted self-reported consequences of abuse (e.g., fear, injuries). More abusive parties, as identified by their partners on the MASIC, had more Protective Orders and No Contact Orders and criminal convictions and crimes potentially related to IPV/A.

"Objectives. We describe a statewide effort to implement detention-based mental health screening and assess follow-up services offered to detained youths in Indiana. Methods. A total of 25 265 detention stays (15 461 unique youths) occurred between January 1, 2008, and December 31, 2011, across 16 detention centers participating in the Indiana Juvenile Mental Health Screening Project. We collected screening results and reports of detention-based follow-up mental health services and referrals from justice system records. Results. Approximately 21% of youths screened positive for mental health issues requiring follow-up. A positive screen significantly predicted that youths would receive a follow-up mental health service or referral while detained or upon detention center discharge, compared with youths who did not screen positive (61% vs 39%). Logistic regression models indicated that a positive screen was associated with (1) contact with a mental health clinician within 24 hours of detention center intake and (2) a mental health referral upon discharge. White youths were more likely than minorities to receive both follow-up services. Conclusions. Future statewide efforts to improve the mental health of detained youths should incorporate standards for providing appropriate follow-up services in detention centers.",,,"Aalsma, MC|Perkins, AJ|Schwartz, K","Aalsma, Matthew C.|Perkins, Anthony J.|Schwartz, Katherine",E82,-1,,,,,,,-1,,-1,,,,,,,,Article,10.2105/AJPH.2014.302054,,,,E88,Clarivate Analytics Web of Science,,,,,,0090-0036,10,,,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH,,,,JUVENILE DETENTION FACILITIES|RACIAL DISPARITIES|JUSTICE|OFFENDERS|CARE|ADOLESCENTS|DISORDERS|RACE,-1,,,,OCT,J,2014,,,,,,"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health",,-1,,"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health",,10,A Statewide Collaboration to Initiate Mental Health Screening and Assess Services for Detained Youths in Indiana,10,,WOS:000341865000013,1,104,1541-0048,25121815,C:\Users\mginda\Desktop\agc1\wos-extract.isi,"Aalsma MC, 2014, V104, E82, DOI 10.2105/AJPH.2014.302054"
"The Developmental Origin of Health and Disease (DOHaD) hypothesis is a broad theoretical framework that emphasizes how early risk factors causally influence psychopathology. Researchers have raised concerns about the causal interpretation of statistical associations between early risk factors and later psychopathology because most studies have been unable to rule out the possibility of environmental and genetic confounding. In this article, we illustrate how family-based, quasi-experimental designs can test the DOHaD hypothesis by ruling out alternative hypotheses. We review the logic underlying sibling-comparison, cotwin control, offspring of siblings/twins, adoption, and in vitro fertilization designs. We then present results from studies using these designs focused on broad indices of fetal development (low birth weight and gestational age) and a particular teratogen, smoking during pregnancy. The results provide mixed support for the DOHaD hypothesis for psychopathology, illustrating the critical need to use designs that rule out unmeasured confounding.",,,"Class, QA|Donofrio, B|Lahey, BB|Larsson, H","Class, Quetzal A.|Donofrio, Brian|Lahey, Benjamin B.|Larsson, Henrik",151,-1,,,,,,,-1,,-1,,,,,,,,Article,10.1111/cdep.12078,,,,157,Clarivate Analytics Web of Science,,,,,,1750-8592,3,,,CHILD DEVELOPMENT PERSPECTIVES,,,,MATERNAL SMOKING|ANTISOCIAL-BEHAVIOR|BIRTH-WEIGHT|IN-UTERO|PREGNANCY|EXPOSURE|RISK|ADOLESCENCE|DISORDERS|CHILDHOOD,-1,"Larsson, Henrik/0000-0002-6851-3297",developmental origins of health and disease|pregnancy|quasi-experiment|birth weight|preterm birth|smoking during pregnancy,,SEP,J,2014,,,,,,"Psychology, Developmental",,-1,,Psychology,,13,"Testing the Developmental Origins of Health and Disease Hypothesis for Psychopathology Using Family-Based, Quasi-Experimental Designs",13,,WOS:000344781700006,1,8,1750-8606,25364377,C:\Users\mginda\Desktop\agc1\wos-extract.isi,"Donofrio B, 2014, V8, P151, DOI 10.1111/cdep.12078"
"Although the past decade has witnessed a growth in research on Asian Americans' suicide-related outcomes, previous studies have tended not to address within-group ethnic variability among Asian Americans. Therefore, this study examined ethnic differences in suicide ideation in a nationally representative sample of Asian Americans that included the six largest Asian American ethnic groups-Chinese, Filipino, Indian, Japanese, Korean, and Vietnamese Americans. Participants were 1,332 Asian American adults who participated in the National Epidemiologic Survey of Alcohol and Related Conditions. The authors found that participants who had lived a longer proportion of their lives in the United States had increased odds of lifetime suicide ideation. There were significant ethnic differences in suicide ideation rates, with Korean Americans and Indian Americans reporting the highest and lowest ideation rates, respectively. Ethnicity was also a significant moderator of the relationship between proportion of life in the United Sates and suicide ideation. The potential adverse impact of proportion of life in the United States on suicide ideation was weaker among Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and Vietnamese Americans, relative to non-Chinese, non-Japanese, non-Korean, and non-Vietnamese Asian Americans, respectively. In contrast, the association between proportion of life in the United States and suicide ideation was stronger among Indian Americans than among non-Indian Americans. These findings underscore the importance of disaggregating data on Asian American suicide-related outcomes.",,,"Chang, TK|Liu, T|Vaughan, EL|Wong, YJ","Chang, Tiffany K.|Liu, Tao|Vaughan, Ellen L.|Wong, Y.

"Gender roles are often cited as a culturally specific predictor of drinking among Latino populations. This study used latent class regression to test the relationships between gender roles and binge drinking in a sample of Latino emerging adults. Participants were Latino emerging adults who participated in Wave III of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (N = 2,442). A subsample of these participants (n = 660) completed the Bem Sex Role Inventory-Short. We conducted latent class regression using 3 dimensions of gender roles (femininity, social masculinity, and personal masculinity) to predict binge drinking. Results indicated a 3-class solution. In Class 1, the protective personal masculinity class, personal masculinity (e. g., being a leader, defending one's own beliefs) was associated with a reduction in the odds of binge drinking. In Class 2, the nonsignificant class, gender roles were not related to binge drinking. In Class 3, the mixed masculinity class, personal masculinity was associated with a reduction in the odds of binge drinking, whereas social masculinity (e. g., forceful, dominant) was associated with an increase in the odds of binge drinking. Post hoc analyses found that females, those born outside the United States, and those with greater English language usage were at greater odds of being in Class 1 (vs. Class 2). Males, those born outside the United States, and those with greater Spanish language usage were at greater odds of being in Class 3 (vs. Class 2).

"Maternal smoking during pregnancy (SDP) has been associated with several psychiatric outcomes in the offspring; studies have questioned whether the associations are causal, however. We analyzed all children born in Sweden between 1983 and 2009 to investigate the effect of SDP on multiple indicators of adverse outcomes in three areas: pregnancy outcomes (birth weight, preterm birth and being born small for gestational age), long-term cognitive abilities (low academic achievement and general cognitive ability) and externalizing behaviors (criminal conviction, violent criminal conviction and drug misuse). SDP was associated with all outcomes. Within-family analyses of the pregnancy outcomes were consistent with a causal interpretation as the associations persisted when siblings discordant for SDP were compared. For the cognitive and externalizing outcomes, the results were not consistent with causal effects; when comparing differentially exposed siblings none of the associations remained significant. In quantitative genetic models genetic factors explained the majority of the associations between SDP and cognitive and externalizing outcomes. The results suggest that the associations between SDP in mothers and cognition and externalizing behaviors in their offspring is primarily due to genetic effects that influence the behaviors in both generations.",,,"D'Onofrio, BM|Kuja-Halkola, R|Larsson, H|Lichtenstein, P","D'Onofrio, Brian M.|Kuja-Halkola, Ralf|Larsson, Henrik|Lichtenstein, Paul",456,-1,,,,,,,-1,,-1,,,,,,,,Article,10.1007/s10519-014-9668-4,,,,467,Clarivate Analytics Web of Science,,,,,,0001-8244,5,,,BEHAVIOR GENETICS,,,,CIGARETTE-SMOKING|CHILD OUTCOMES|SUBSTANCE USE|RISK-FACTORS|DRUG-ABUSE|CAUSAL|EXPOSURE|TWINS|ASSOCIATION|PERFORMANCE,-1,"Kuja-Halkola, Ralf/0000-0002-3765-2067; lichtenstein, paul/0000-0003-3037-5287; Larsson, Henrik/0000-0002-6851-3297",Smoking during pregnancy|Children of siblings|Sibling comparison|Cousin comparison|Extended family model,,SEP,J,2014,,,,,,"Behavioral Sciences|Genetics & Heredity|Psychology, Multidisciplinary",,-1,,Behavioral Sciences; Genetics & Heredity; Psychology,,24,Maternal Smoking During Pregnancy and Adverse Outcomes in Offspring: Genetic and Environmental Sources of Covariance,24,,WOS:000341495100004,1,44,1573-3297,25117564,C:\Users\mginda\Desktop\agc1\wos-extract.isi,"Kuja-Halkola R, 2014, V44, P456, DOI 10.1007/s10519-014-9668-4"
"Purpose: Parental severe mental illness (SMI) is associated with an increased risk of offspring autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). We conducted a study to examine the extent to which risk of preterm birth, low birth weight, and small for gestational age mediated this association. Methods: We obtained data on offspring born 1992-2001 in Sweden (n = 870,017) through the linkage of multiple population-based registers. We used logistic and Cox regression to assess the associations between parental SMI, adverse pregnancy outcomes, and offspring ASD and ADHD, as well as tested whether adverse pregnancy outcomes served as mediators. Results: After controlling for measured covariates, maternal and paternal SMI were associated with an increased risk for preterm birth, low birth weight, and gestational age, and for offspring ASD and ADHD. These pregnancy outcomes were also associated with an increased risk of ASD and ADHD. We found that pregnancy outcomes did not mediate the association between parental SMI and offspring ASD and ADHD, as there was no substantial change in magnitude of the risk estimates after controlling for pregnancy outcomes. Conclusions: Parental SMI and adverse pregnancy outcomes appear to be independent risk factors for offspring ASD and ADHD. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

"The rate at which alcohol (ethanol) is consumed has direct impact on its behavioral and subjective effects. For this reason, alterations in the pattern of ethanol consumption as a function of drinking history might be critical to the development and maintenance of alcoholism. Furthermore, because pharmacological interventions aimed at disrupting the motivation to consume ethanol are dependent on the brain/plasma concentrations present when an individual is most likely to engage in consumption of this substance, characterizing temporal drinking patterns might be useful to determine the timing of such treatments. The primary goal of the present study was to evaluate alterations in the timecourse of daily binge (drinking-in-the-dark; DID) ethanol consumption. We gave 14 daily 2 hour DID ethanol or water access sessions to male C57BL/6J (B6) mice using a state of the art volumetric drinking monitoring device. We then, primarily as a proof-of-principle, used the GABA(B) allosteric modulator GS39783 (GS) to determine how this compound influenced the timecourse of binge-like ethanol intake. The rate of ethanol consumption increased dramatically over sessions with the majority occurring in the first few minutes of the final session. Additionally, ethanol consumption occurring immediately following access was almost completely abolished in mice pre-treated with GS; an effect which was ethanol-specific only at this early time interval. These data characterize progressive alterations in the rate of ethanol intake using the DID model and suggest that careful consideration of prior ethanol history and timing of drug administration are warranted when interpreting results of pre-clinical drug administration studies.",,,"Boehm, SL|Linsenbardt, DN","Boehm, Stephen L., II|Linsenbardt, David N.",812,-1,,,,,,,-1,,-1,,,,,,,,Article,10.1111/adb.12052,,,,825,Clarivate Analytics Web of Science,,,,,,1369-1600,5,,,ADDICTION BIOLOGY,,,,POSITIVE ALLOSTERIC MODULATOR|ALCOHOL-PREFERRING RATS|GABA(B) RECEPTOR|MOTIVATIONAL PROPERTIES|C57BL/6J MICE|GS39783|DRINKING|INTOXICATION|DEPENDENCE|REDUCTION,-1,,Binge DID alcohol intake|mouse locomotor behavior|pre-clinical pharmacology,,SEP,J,2014,,,,,,Biochemistry & Molecular Biology|Substance Abuse,,-1,,Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Substance Abuse,,19,Alterations in the rate of binge ethanol consumption: implications for preclinical studies in mice,19,,WOS:000340532600007,1,19,,23742054,C:\Users\mginda\Desktop\agc1\wos-extract.isi,"Linsenbardt DN, 2014, V19, P812, DOI 10.1111/adb.12052"

"Background: Readmissions after hospital discharge are a common occurrence and are costly for both hospitals and patients. Previous attempts to create universal risk prediction models for readmission have not met with success. In this study we leveraged a comprehensive electronic health record to create readmission-risk models that were institution-and patient-specific in an attempt to improve our ability to predict readmission. Methods: This is a retrospective cohort study performed at a large midwestern tertiary care medical center. All patients with a primary discharge diagnosis of congestive heart failure, acute myocardial infarction or pneumonia over a two-year time period were included in the analysis. The main outcome was 30-day readmission. Demographic, comorbidity, laboratory, and medication data were collected on all patients from a comprehensive information warehouse. Using multivariable analysis with stepwise removal we created three risk disease-specific risk prediction models and a combined model. These models were then validated on separate cohorts. Results: 3572 patients were included in the derivation cohort. Overall there was a 16.2% readmission rate. The acute myocardial infarction and pneumonia readmission-risk models performed well on a random sample validation cohort (AUC range 0.73 to 0.76) but less well on a historical validation cohort (AUC 0.66 for both). The congestive heart failure model performed poorly on both validation cohorts (AUC 0.63 and 0.64). Conclusions: The readmission-risk models for acute myocardial infarction and pneumonia validated well on a contemporary cohort, but not as well on a historical cohort, suggesting that models such as these need to be continuously trained and adjusted to respond to local trends. The poor performance of the congestive heart failure model may suggest that for chronic disease conditions social and behavioral variables are of greater importance and improved documentation of these variables within the electronic health record should be encouraged.",,"Embi, Peter/E-3030-2011; Hebert, Courtney/G-4900-2016","Embi, PJ|Foraker, RE|Hebert, C|Lemeshow, S|Mekhjian, H|Roth, C|Shivade, CP|Wasserman, J","Embi, Peter J.|Foraker, Randi E.|Hebert, Courtney|Lemeshow, Stanley|Mekhjian, Hagop|Roth, Caryn|Shivade, Chaitanya P.|Wasserman, Jared",,-1,,,,,,,-1,,-1,,,,,,,,Article,10.1186/1472-6947-14-65,,,,,Clarivate Analytics Web of Science,,,,,,1472-6947,,,,BMC MEDICAL INFORMATICS AND DECISION MAKING,,,65,CONGESTIVE-HEART-FAILURE|POTENTIALLY PREVENTABLE READMISSIONS|HOSPITAL READMISSION|30-DAY READMISSION|MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES|RESOURCE UTILIZATION|ADMINISTRATIVE DATA|CARE|REHOSPITALIZATION|OUTCOMES,-1,"Shivade, Chaitanya/0000-0001-6604-1129",Readmissions|Risk-prediction|Electronic health records,,4-Aug,J,2014,,,,,,Medical Informatics,,-1,,Medical Informatics,,17,Diagnosis-specific readmission risk prediction using electronic health data: a retrospective cohort study,17,,WOS:000341054800001,1,14,,25091637,C:\Users\mginda\Desktop\agc1\wos-extract.isi,"Hebert C, 2014, V14, DOI 10.1186/1472-6947-14-65"
"Background: The combination of highly caffeinated ""energy drinks"" with alcohol (ethanol [ EtOH]) has become popular among young adults and intoxication via such beverages has been associated with an elevated risk for harmful behaviors. However, there are discrepancies in the human literature regarding the effect of caffeine on alcohol intoxication, perhaps due to confounding factors such as personality type, expectancy, and history of exposure. Animal models of co-exposure are resistant to such issues; however, the consequences of voluntary co-consumption have been largely ignored in the animal literature. The primary goal of this work was to characterize a mouse model of binge caffeine and EtOH co-consumption employing the limited access ""Drinking-in-the-Dark"" (DID) paradigm. Methods: Caffeine was added to a 20% alcohol solution via DID. Alcohol/caffeine intake, locomotor behavior, ataxia, anxiety-like behavior, and cognitive function were evaluated as a consequence of co-consumption in adult male C57BL/6J mice. Results: Caffeine did not substantially alter binge alcohol intake or resultant blood EtOH concentrations (BECs), nor did it alter alcohol's anxiolytic effects on the elevated plus maze or cognitive-interfering effects in a novel object-recognition task. However, no evidence of alcohol-induced sedation was observed in co-consumption groups that instead demonstrated a highly stimulated state similar to that of caffeine alone. The addition of caffeine was also found to mitigate alcohol-induced ataxia. Conclusions: Taken together, our mouse model indicates that binge co-consumption of caffeine and alcohol produces a stimulated, less ataxic and anxious, as well as cognitively altered state; a state that could be of great public health concern. These results appear to resemble the colloquially identified ""wide awake drunk"" state that individuals seek via consumption of such beverages. This self-administration model therefore offers the capacity for translationally valid explorations of the neurobiological consequences of binge co-consumption to assess the public health risk of this drug combination.",,,"Boehm, SL|Companion, M|Fritz, BM","Boehm, Stephen L.|Companion, Michel|Fritz, Brandon M.",2269,-1,,,,,,,-1,,-1,,,,,,,,Article,10.1111/acer.12472,,,,2278,Clarivate Analytics Web of Science,,,,,,0145-6008,8,,,ALCOHOLISM-CLINICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL RESEARCH,,,,ENERGY DRINK CONSUMPTION|NUCLEOSIDE TRANSPORTER|SUBJECTIVE REPORTS|ETHANOL INTAKE|RISK-TAKING|MICE|ADENOSINE|PERFORMANCE|LOCOMOTOR|C57BL/6J,-1,,Alcohol|Caffeine|Drinking-in-the-Dark|Psychostimulant|Mouse,,AUG,J,2014,,,,,,Substance Abuse,,-1,,Substance Abuse,,13,"""Wired,"" Yet Intoxicated: Modeling Binge Caffeine and Alcohol Co-Consumption in the Mouse",14,,WOS:000341181900016,1,38,1530-0277,24961658,C:\Users\mginda\Desktop\agc1\wos-extract.isi,"Fritz BM, 2014, V38, P2269, DOI 10.1111/acer.12472"
"Background: There are persistent concerns of long-term effects of stimulant ADHD medication on the development of substance abuse. Methods: Using Swedish national registers, we studied all individuals born between 1960 and 1998 and diagnosed with ADHD (26,249 men and 12,504 women). We investigated the association between stimulant ADHD medication in 2006 and substance abuse during 2009. Substance abuse was indexed by substance-related death, crime, or hospital visits. Results: ADHD medication was not associated with increased rate of substance abuse. Actually, the rate during 2009 was 31% lower among those prescribed ADHD medication in 2006, even after controlling for medication in 2009 and other covariates (hazard ratio: 0.69; 95% confidence interval: 0.57-0.84). Also, the longer the duration of medication, the lower the rate of substance abuse. Similar risk reductions were suggested among children and when investigating the association between stimulant ADHD medication and concomitant short-term abuse. Conclusions: We found no indication of increased risks of substance abuse among individuals prescribed stimulant ADHD medication; if anything, the data suggested a long-term protective effect on substance abuse. Although stimulant ADHD medication does not seem to increase the risk for substance abuse, clinicians should remain alert to the potential problem of stimulant misuse and diversion in ADHD patients.",,"Serlachius, Eva/E-8956-2013","Chang, Z|D'Onofrio, BM|Fazel, S|Halldner, L|Langstorm, N|Larsson, H|Lichtenstein, P|Serlachius, E","Chang, Zheng|D'Onofrio, Brian M.|Fazel, Seena|Halldner, Linda|Langstorm, Niklas|Larsson, Henrik|Lichtenstein, Paul|Serlachius, Eva",878,-1,,,,,,,-1,,-1,,,,,,,,Article,10.1111/jcpp.12164,,,,885,Clarivate Analytics Web of Science,,,,,,0021-9630,8,,,JOURNAL OF CHILD PSYCHOLOGY AND PSYCHIATRY,,,,ATTENTION-DEFICIT/HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER|DEFICIT-HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER|PROSPECTIVE FOLLOW-UP|DOUBLE-BLIND|METHYLPHENIDATE TREATMENT|PARALLEL-GROUP|USE OUTCOMES|DRUG-ABUSE|CHILDREN|ADULTS,-1,"Serlachius, Eva/0000-0001-7115-6422; lichtenstein, paul/0000-0003-3037-5287; Halldner Henriksson, Linda/0000-0003-0561-5998; Larsson, Henrik/0000-0002-6851-3297",ADHD|pharmacology|substance abuse,,AUG,J,2014,,,,,,"Psychology, Developmental|Psychiatry|Psychology",,-1,,Psychology; Psychiatry,,40,Stimulant ADHD medication and risk for substance abuse,40,,WOS:000339384700005,1,55,1469-7610,25158998,C:\Users\mginda\Desktop\agc1\wos-extract.isi,"Chang Z, 2014, V55, P878, DOI 10.1111/jcpp.12164"

"The United States has a significant shortage of trained geriatricians and of nurses, social workers, and paraprofessionals educated to care for elderly adults. As the aging population continues to grow, providing high-quality care will require new models that better address the many needs of aging individuals and their caregivers, using cost-effective strategies. Responding to this need, the Indiana University Center for Aging Research implementation scientists developed, tested, and are now scaling up a successful collaborative care coordination model for older adults with dementia, depression, or both: the Aging Brain Care program. This model now includes a newly created frontline care provider position, the Care Coordinator Assistant. The Care Coordinator Assistant works with individuals and caregivers to monitor biopsychosocial needs and deliver evidence-based and individualized care protocols, with close supervision from the registered nurse Care Coordinator. Recognizing that current hiring practices for frontline providers were insufficient to screen for critical abilities expected in this new position, including the ability to express ""caring"" and empathy, a new screening process was created building on the Multiple Mini Interview (MMI) format. The Care Coordinator Assistant MMI comprised six stations, each created to simulate challenging scenarios that will be frequently encountered and to assess important candidate abilities. Overall, the six-station MMI, with two to three items per station, provided factorially valid measures and good predictive ability. The process did not appear to be overly burdensome for candidates, and interviewers noted that it was helpful in discriminating between candidates.",,,"Alder, CA|Austrom, MG|Boustani, MA|Cottingham, AH|Johnson, CS|Litzelman, DK","Alder, C.

"Background. No prior twin study has explored the heritability of clinically diagnosed attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Such studies are needed to resolve conflicting results regarding the importance of genetic effects for ADHD in adults. We aimed to estimate the relative contribution of genetic and environmental influences for clinically diagnosed ADHD across the lifespan with a specific focus on ADHD in adults. Method. Information on zygosity and sex was obtained from 59514 twins born between 1959 and 2001 included in the nationwide population-based Swedish Twin Registry. Clinical data for ADHD diagnoses (i.e. stimulant or non-stimulant medication for ADHD) were obtained from the Swedish Prescribed Drug Register (PDR) and from the National Patient Register (i.e. ICD-10 diagnosis of ADHD). Twin methods were applied to clinical data of ADHD diagnoses using structural equation modeling with monozygotic (MZ) and dizygotic (DZ) twins. Results. The best-fitting model revealed a high heritability of ADHD [0.88, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.83-0.92] for the entire sample. However, shared environmental effects were non-significant and of minimal importance. The heritability of ADHD in adults was also substantial (0.72, 95% CI 0.56-0.84). Conclusions. This study shows that the heritability of clinically diagnosed ADHD is high across the lifespan. Our finding of high heritability for clinically diagnosed ADHD in adults indicates that the previous reports of low heritability are best explained by rater effects, and that gene-identification studies of ADHD in adults need to consider pervasiveness (e.g. multiple raters) and developmentally (e.g. childhood-onset criteria) informative data.",,,"Chang, Z|D'Onofrio, BM|Larsson, H|Lichtenstein, P","Chang, Zheng|D'Onofrio, Brian M.|Larsson, Henrik|Lichtenstein, Paul",2223,-1,,,,,,,-1,,-1,,,,,,,,Article,10.1017/S0033291713002493,,,,2229,Clarivate Analytics Web of Science,,,,,,0033-2917,10,,,PSYCHOLOGICAL MEDICINE,,,,DEFICIT/HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER|ENVIRONMENTAL-INFLUENCES|ADHD|TWIN|CHILDHOOD|SYMPTOMS|GENETICS|RISK|PSYCHOPATHOLOGY|METAANALYSIS,-1,"lichtenstein, paul/0000-0003-3037-5287; Larsson, Henrik/0000-0002-6851-3297",ADHD|adults|heritability|twin study,,JUL,J,2014,,,,,,"Psychology, Clinical|Psychiatry|Psychology",,-1,,Psychology; Psychiatry,,56,The heritability of clinically diagnosed attention deficit hyperactivity disorder across the lifespan,56,,WOS:000337755100018,1,44,1469-8978,24107258,C:\Users\mginda\Desktop\agc1\wos-extract.isi,"Larsson H, 2014, V44, P2223, DOI 10.1017/S0033291713002493"
"Objective To investigate the association between drug treatment for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and risk of concomitant suicidal behaviour among patients with ADHD. Design Register based longitudinal study using within patient design. Setting Linkage of multiple national registers in Sweden. Participants 37 936 patients with ADHD born between 1960 and 1996 and followed from 2006 to 2009 for treatment status by ADHD drug treatment and suicide related events (suicide attempt and completed suicide). Main outcome measure Incidence rate of suicide related events during ADHD drug treatment periods compared with that during non-treatment periods. Results Among 37 936 patients with ADHD, 7019 suicide related events occurred during 150 721 person years of follow-up. At the population level, drug treatment of ADHD was associated with an increased rate of suicide related events (hazard ratio 1.31, 95% confidence interval 1.19 to 1.44). However, the within patient comparison showed a reverse association between ADHD drug treatment and rate of suicide related events (0.89, 0.79 to 1.00). Among stimulant users, a reduced within patient rate of suicide related events was seen during treatment periods (0.81, 0.70 to 0.94). Among non-stimulant/mixed users, no significantly increased within patient rate of suicide related events during non-stimulant treatment periods was seen (0.96, 0.72 to 1.30). Conclusions This study found no evidence for a positive association between the use of drug treatments for ADHD and the risk of concomitant suicidal behaviour among patients with ADHD. If anything, the results pointed to a potential protective effect of drugs for ADHD on suicidal behaviour, particularly for stimulant drugs. The study highlights the importance of using within patient designs to control for confounding in future pharmacoepidemiological studies.",,,"Chen, Q|D'Onofrio, BM|Larsson, H|Lichtenstein, P|Runeson, B|Sjolander, A","Chen, Qi|D'Onofrio, Brian M.|Larsson, Henrik|Lichtenstein, Paul|Runeson, Bo|Sjolander, Arvid",,-1,,,,,,,-1,,-1,,,,,,,,Article,10.1136/bmj.g3769,,,,,Clarivate Analytics Web of Science,,,,,,1756-1833,,,,BMJ-BRITISH MEDICAL JOURNAL,,,g3769,DEFICIT-HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER|AGE-DEPENDENT DECLINE|FOLLOW-UP|YOUNG-ADULTS|ADOLESCENT|CHILDREN|SAFETY|ADHD|METAANALYSIS|ATOMOXETINE,-1,"Larsson, Henrik/0000-0002-6851-3297; Runeson, Bo/0000-0003-4122-4636; Chen, Qi/0000-0002-4602-4388; lichtenstein, paul/0000-0003-3037-5287",,,18-Jun,J,2014,,,,,,"Medicine, General & Internal",,-1,,General & Internal Medicine,,28,Drug treatment for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and suicidal behaviour: register based study,29,,WOS:000337805600002,1,348,,24942388,C:\Users\mginda\Desktop\agc1\wos-extract.isi,"Chen Q, 2014, V348, DOI 10.1136/bmj.g3769"

"Time motion studies were first described in the early 20th century in industrial engineering, referring to a quantitative data collection method where an external observer captured detailed data on the duration and movements required to accomplish a specific task, coupled with an analysis focused on improving efficiency. Since then, they have been broadly adopted by biomedical researchers and have become a focus of attention due to the current interest in clinical workflow related factors. However, attempts to aggregate results from these studies have been difficult, resulting from a significant variability in the implementation and reporting of methods. While efforts have been made to standardize the reporting of such data and findings, a lack of common understanding on what ""time motion studies"" are remains, which not only hinders reviews, but could also partially explain the methodological variability in the domain literature (duration of the observations, number of tasks, multitasking, training rigor and reliability assessments) caused by an attempt to cluster dissimilar sub-techniques. A crucial milestone towards the standardization and validation of time motion studies corresponds to a common understanding, accompanied by a proper recognition of the distinct techniques it encompasses. Towards this goal, we conducted a review of the literature aiming at identifying what is being referred to as ""time motion studies"". We provide a detailed description of the distinct methods used in articles referenced or classified as ""time motion studies"", and conclude that currently it is used not only to define the original technique, but also to describe a broad spectrum of studies whose only common factor is the capture and/or analysis of the duration of one or more events. To maintain alignment with the existing broad scope of the term, we propose a disambiguation approach by preserving the expanded conception, while recommending the use of a specific qualifier ""continuous observation time motion studies"" to refer to variations of the original method (the use of an external observer recording data continuously). In addition, we present a more granular naming for sub-techniques within continuous observation time motion studies, expecting to reduce the methodological variability within each sub-technique and facilitate future results aggregation.

"Objectives To analyze parents who self-identified themselves as being proactive parents (PPs) compared with non-PPs who were queried about their teen's health to understand common adolescent health concerns, parenting practices/behaviors around health, and whether their adolescent had received a preventive care visit in the last year Study design Secondary analyses of parents (n = 504) from a nationally representative online panel were surveyed to assess health beliefs/attitudes, perceived adolescent health concerns, frequency of health discussions, topics that pediatricians should discuss, and their teen's last annual visit. Demographics, parental beliefs, frequency of health conversations, and topics that physicians should discuss were compared. Logistic regression determined the likelihood of PPs compared with non-PPs reporting a teen annual health visit within the last year. Results Greater education and having a single-child household were slightly more common among PPs. PPs expressed greater concern about their teens getting good grades, getting sick, and their teen's future (P < .001). PPs indicated a greater severity of worry (P < .02) across all health topics and rated issues of sexual health, vaccines, and stress/mental health as very important for pediatricians to discuss (P < .01). Controlling for demographics, PPs were 3.4 (95% CI 2.06-5.56) times more likely to report an annual visit of their teen in the last year. Conclusion PPs are an asset to the health promotion and the well-being of their teens. PPs were more likely to have their teen receive an annual visit, report more frequent discussions about health, and place a high value on physician discussions about health.",,,"Aalsma, MC|Gilbert, AL|Rickert, VI","Aalsma, Matthew C.|Gilbert, Amy L.|Rickert, Vaughn I.",1390,-1,,,,,,,-1,,-1,,,,,,,,Article,10.1016/j.jpeds.2014.02.015,,,,1395,Clarivate Analytics Web of Science,,,,,,0022-3476,6,,,JOURNAL OF PEDIATRICS,,,,PREVENTIVE SERVICES|UNITED-STATES|ADOLESCENTS|CARE|INITIATION|PATTERNS|CHILDREN|ALCOHOL,-1,,,,JUN,J,2014,,,,,,Pediatrics,,-1,,Pediatrics,,7,Proactive Parents Are Assets to the Health and Well-Being of Teens,7,,WOS:000336503200032,1,164,1097-6833,24630356,C:\Users\mginda\Desktop\agc1\wos-extract.isi,"Rickert VI, 2014, V164, P1390, DOI 10.1016/j.jpeds.2014.02.015"
"Background: Obesity and overweight are multifactorial diseases that affect two thirds of Americans, lead to numerous health conditions and deeply strain our healthcare system. With the increasing prevalence and dangers associated with higher body weight, there is great impetus to focus on public health strategies to prevent or curb the disease. Electronic health records (EHRs) are a powerful source for retrospective health data, but they lack important community-level information known to be associated with obesity. We explored linking EHR and community data to study factors associated with overweight and obesity in a systematic and rigorous way. Methods: We augmented EHR-derived data on 62,701 patients with zip code-level socioeconomic and obesogenic data. Using a multinomial logistic regression model, we estimated odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals (OR, 95% CI) for community-level factors associated with overweight and obese body mass index (BMI), accounting for the clustering of patients within zip codes. Results: 33, 31 and 35 percent of individuals had BMIs corresponding to normal, overweight and obese, respectively. Models adjusted for age, race and gender showed more farmers' markets/1,000 people (0.19, 0.10-0.36), more grocery stores/1,000 people (0.58, 0.36-0.93) and a 10% increase in percentage of college graduates (0.80, 0.77-0.84) were associated with lower odds of obesity. The same factors yielded odds ratios of smaller magnitudes for overweight. Our results also indicate that larger grocery stores may be inversely associated with obesity. Conclusions: Integrating community data into the EHR maximizes the potential of secondary use of EHR data to study and impact obesity prevention and other significant public health issues.",,"Embi, Peter/E-3030-2011","Embi, PJ|Foraker, RE|Payne, PRO|Roth, C","Embi, Peter J.|Foraker, Randi E.|Payne, Philip R.

"Background: We examined timing of substance involvement as a joint function of parental history of alcoholism and parental separation during childhood. Method: Data were drawn from a large cohort of female like-sex twins [n= 613 African Ancestry (AA), n = 3550 European or other ancestry (EA)]. Cox proportional hazards regression was conducted predicting age at first use of alcohol, first alcohol intoxication, first use and regular use of cigarettes, and first use of cannabis and other illicit drugs from dummy variables coding for parental alcoholism and parental separation. Propensity score analysis was also conducted comparing intact and separated families by predicted probability of parental separation. Results: In EA families, increased risk of substance involvement was found in both alcoholic and separated families, particularly through ages 10 or 14 years, with risk to offspring from alcoholic separated families further increased. In AA families, associations with parental alcoholism and parental separation were weak and with few exceptions statistically nonsignificant. While propensity score findings confirmed unique risks observed in EA families, intact and separated AA families were poorly matched on risk-factors presumed to predate parental separation, especially parental alcoholism, requiring cautious interpretation of AA survival-analytic findings. Conclusion: For offspring of European ancestry, parental separation predicts early substance involvement that is not explained by parental alcoholism nor associated family background characteristics. Additional research is needed to better characterize risks associated with parental separation in African American families. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

"BackgroundInitial sensitivity to ethanol (EtOH) and the capacity to develop acute functional tolerance (AFT) to its adverse effects may influence the amount of alcohol consumed and may also predict future alcohol use patterns. The current study assessed sensitivity and AFT to the ataxic and hypnotic effects of EtOH in the first replicate of mice (HDID-1) selectively bred for high blood EtOH concentrations (BECs) following limited access to EtOH in the Drinking in the Dark (DID) paradigm. MethodsNaive male and female HDID-1 and HS/Npt mice from the progenitor stock were evaluated in 3 separate experiments. In Experiments 1 and 2, EtOH-induced ataxia was assessed using the static dowel task. In Experiment 3, EtOH-induced hypnosis was assessed by using modified restraint tubes to measure the loss of righting reflex (LORR). ResultsHDID-1 mice exhibited reduced initial sensitivity to both EtOH-induced ataxia (p<0.001) and hypnosis (p<0.05) relative to HS/Npt mice. AFT was calculated by subtracting the BEC at loss of function from the BEC at recovery (Experiments 1 and 3) or by subtracting BEC at an initial recovery from the BEC at a second recovery following an additional alcohol dose (Experiment 2). The dowel test yielded no line differences in AFT, but HS/Npt mice developed slightly greater AFT to EtOH-induced LORR than HDID-1 (p<0.05). ConclusionsThese results suggest that HDID-1 mice exhibit aspects of blunted ataxic and hypnotic sensitivity to EtOH which may influence their high EtOH intake via DID, but do not display widely different development of AFT.

Methods A total of 811,803 individuals born in Sweden between 1992 and 2000 were included in this nationwide population-based cohort study. Diagnosis of ADHD was assessed via the Swedish national Patient Register and the Swedish Prescribed Drug Register. Annual family income during offspring's first 5years in life was collected prospectively from the Swedish Integrated Database for Labour Market Research and divided into quartiles by (lower) family disposable income. We predicted ADHD from family income while controlling for covariates and also comparing differently exposed cousins and siblings to control for unmeasured familial confounding. Results The crude analyses suggested that children exposed to lower income levels were at increased risk for ADHD (HRQuartile1=2.52; 95% CI, 2.42-2.63; HRQuartile2=1.52; 95% CI, 1.45-1.58; HRQuartile3=1.20; 95% CI, 1.14-1.15). This dose-dependent association decreased after adjustment for measured covariates (HRQuartile1=2.09; 95% CI, 2.00-2.19; HRQuartile2=1.36; 95% CI, 1.30-1.42; HRQuartile3=1.13; 95% CI, 1.08-1.18). Although the association was attenuated in cousin comparisons (HRQuartile1=1.61; 95% CI, 1.40-1.84; HRQuartile2=1.28; 95% CI, 1.12-1.45; HRQuartile3=1.14; 95% CI, 1.01-1.28) and sibling comparison models (HRQuartile1=1.37; 95% CI, 1.07-1.75; HRQuartile2=1.37; 95% CI, 1.12-1.68; HRQuartile3=1.23; 95% CI, 1.04-1.45), it remained statistically significant across all levels of decreased disposable family income. Conclusions Our results indicated that low family income in early childhood was associated with increased likelihood of ADHD. The link remained even after controlling for unmeasured selection factors, highlighting family income in early childhood as a marker of causal factors for ADHD.",,,"D'Onofrio, BM|Langstorm, N|Larsson, H|Lichtenstein, P|Sariaslan, A","D'Onofrio, Brian M.|Langstorm, Niklas|Larsson, Henrik|Lichtenstein, Paul|Sariaslan, Amir",428,-1,,,,,,,-1,,-1,,,,,,,,Article,10.1111/jcpp.12140,,,,435,Clarivate Analytics Web of Science,,,,,,0021-9630,5,,,JOURNAL OF CHILD PSYCHOLOGY AND PSYCHIATRY,,,,DEFICIT HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER|TELEPHONE INTERVIEW|BEHAVIOR PROBLEMS|AUTISM-TICS|DSM-IV|A-TAC|ADHD|ADVERSITY|ASSOCIATION|CHILDREN,-1,"lichtenstein, paul/0000-0003-3037-5287; Larsson, Henrik/0000-0002-6851-3297",causality|family income|ADHD|quasi-experimental approaches|childhood,,MAY,J,2014,,,,,,"Psychology, Developmental|Psychiatry|Psychology",,-1,,Psychology; Psychiatry,,35,Family income in early childhood and subsequent attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder: a quasi-experimental study,35,,WOS:000333816800003,1,55,1469-7610,24111650,C:\Users\mginda\Desktop\agc1\wos-extract.isi,"Larsson H, 2014, V55, P428, DOI 10.1111/jcpp.12140"
"IMPORTANCE Advancing paternal age is associated with increased genetic mutations during spermatogenesis, which research suggests may cause psychiatric morbidity in the offspring. The effects of advancing paternal age at childbearing on offspring morbidity remain unclear, however, because of inconsistent epidemiologic findings and the inability of previous studies to rigorously rule out confounding factors. OBJECTIVE To examine the associations between advancing paternal age at childbearing and numerous indexes of offspring morbidity. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS We performed a population-based cohort study of all individuals born in Sweden in 1973-2001 (N = 2 615 081), with subsets of the data used to predict childhood or adolescent morbidity. We estimated the risk of psychiatric and academic morbidity associated with advancing paternal age using several quasi-experimental designs, including the comparison of differentially exposed siblings, cousins, and first-born cousins. EXPOSURE Paternal age at childbearing. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Psychiatric (autism, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, psychosis, bipolar disorder, suicide attempt, and substance use problem) and academic (failing grades and low educational attainment) morbidity. RESULTS In the study population, advancing paternal age was associated with increased risk of some psychiatric disorders (eg, autism, psychosis, and bipolar disorders) but decreased risk of the other indexes of morbidity. In contrast, the sibling-comparison analyses indicated that advancing paternal age had a dose-response relationship with every index of morbidity, with the magnitude of the associations being as large or larger than the estimates in the entire population. Compared with offspring born to fathers 20 to 24 years old, offspring of fathers 45 years and older were at heightened risk of autism (hazard ratio [HR] = 3.45; 95% CI, 1.62-7.33), attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (HR = 13.13; 95% CI, 6.85-25.16), psychosis (HR = 2.07; 95% CI, 1.35-3.20), bipolar disorder (HR = 24.70; 95% CI, 12.12-50.31), suicide attempts (HR = 2.72; 95% CI, 2.08-3.56), substance use problems (HR = 2.44; 95% CI, 1.98-2.99), failing a grade (odds ratio [OR] = 1.59; 95% CI, 1.37-1.85), and low educational attainment (OR = 1.70; 95% CI, 1.50-1.93) in within-sibling comparisons. Additional analyses using several quasi-experimental designs obtained commensurate results, further strengthening the internal and external validity of the findings. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Advancing paternal age is associated with increased risk of psychiatric and academic morbidity, with the magnitude of the risks being as large or larger than previous estimates. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that new genetic mutations that occur during spermatogenesis are causally related to offspring morbidity.",,,"Almqvist, C|D'Onofrio, BM|Frans, E|Kuja-Halkola, R|Larsson, H|Lichtenstein, P|Rickert, ME|Sjolander, A","Almqvist, Catarina|D'Onofrio, Brian M.|Frans, Emma|Kuja-Halkola, Ralf|Larsson, Henrik|Lichtenstein, Paul|Rickert, Martin|Sjolander, Arvid",432,-1,,,,,,,-1,,-1,,,,,,,,Article,10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2013.4525,,,,438,Clarivate Analytics Web of Science,,,,,,2168-622X,4,,,JAMA PSYCHIATRY,,,,DE-NOVO MUTATIONS|AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDERS|BIPOLAR DISORDER|MATERNAL SMOKING|PARENTAL AGE|ENVIRONMENTAL-INFLUENCES|PERSONALITY-TRAITS|RISK|SCHIZOPHRENIA|PREGNANCY,-1,"Larsson, Henrik/0000-0002-6851-3297; lichtenstein, paul/0000-0003-3037-5287; Kuja-Halkola, Ralf/0000-0002-3765-2067",,,APR,J,2014,,,,,,Psychiatry,,-1,,Psychiatry,,96,Paternal Age at Childbearing and Offspring Psychiatric and Academic Morbidity,96,,WOS:000335926500014,1,71,2168-6238,24577047,C:\Users\mginda\Desktop\agc1\wos-extract.isi,"D'Onofrio BM, 2014, V71, P432, DOI 10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2013.4525"
"Accessible summary A large number of children drop out or stop attending their mental health counseling appointments before they actually complete all the needed treatment sessions. This is a problem because the children's behavior problems may get worse or affect their willingness to seek treatment in the future. We have not studied how the mental health clinics' daily operations and staff's behaviors may contribute to children, particularly teenagers, drop out from treatment. We asked 12 teenagers and their parents to tell us what about the mental health clinic helped them stay or leave treatment. Having long waits at counseling appointments, frequent changes in staff, and negative staff attitudes led to drop out from treatment. However, having staff who showed respect, involved teenagers and their parents in the counseling sessions, and communicated timely helped to decrease dropout. The parents suggested that provision of automated appointment reminders, transportation to clinics, and provision of education and support groups for caregivers will improve attendance to counseling sessions. An estimated 40-60% of children in mental health treatment drop out before completing their treatment plans, resulting in increased risk for ongoing clinical symptoms and functional impairment, lower satisfaction with treatment, and other poor outcomes. Research has focused predominately on child, caregiver, and family factors that affect treatment participation in this population and relatively less on organizational factors. Findings are limited by focus on children between 3 and 14 years of age and included only caregivers' and/or therapists' perspectives. The purpose of this descriptive qualitative study was to identify organizational factors that influenced participation in treatment, with special attention to factors that contributed to dropout in adolescents. The sample included 12 adolescent-caregiver dyads drawn from two groups in a large public mental health provider database. Analysis of focus group interview data revealed several perceived facilitators and barriers to adolescent participation in treatment and provided several practical suggestions for improving treatment participation. Implications of the findings for psychiatric mental health nurses and other clinicians who provide services to families of adolescents with mental health concerns are discussed.",,,"Aalsma, MC|Downs, SM|Draucker, C|Holloway, ED|Oruche, UM","Aalsma, Matthew C.|Downs, Sarah M.|Draucker, C.|Holloway, Evan D.|Oruche, Ukamaka M.",241,-1,,,,,,,-1,,-1,,,,,,,,Article,10.1111/jpm.12076,,,,248,Clarivate Analytics Web of Science,,,,,,1351-0126,3,,,JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRIC AND MENTAL HEALTH NURSING,,,,OUTPATIENT TREATMENT|CARE NEEDS|ENGAGEMENT|CHILDREN|DROPOUT|PREDICTORS|RETENTION|SERVICES,-1,"Holloway, Evan/0000-0002-6888-8398",adolescent|caregivers|treatment|participation|mental health|dropout,,APR,J,2014,,,,,,Nursing|Psychiatry,,-1,,Nursing; Psychiatry,,14,Barriers and facilitators to treatment participation by adolescents in a community mental health clinic,14,,WOS:000332046300008,1,21,1365-2850,23682756,C:\Users\mginda\Desktop\agc1\wos-extract.isi,"Oruche UM, 2014, V21, P241, DOI 10.1111/jpm.12076"
"IMPORTANCE Studies have shown that attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is associated with transport accidents, but the magnitude of the association remains unclear. Most important, it is also unclear whether ADHD medication reduces this risk. OBJECTIVES To estimate the association between ADHD and the risk of serious transport accidents and to explore the extent to which ADHD medication influences this risk among patients with ADHD. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS In total, 17 408 patients with a diagnosis of ADHD were observed from January 1, 2006, through December 31, 2009, for serious transport accidents documented in Swedish national registers. The association between ADHD and accidents was estimated with Cox proportional hazards regression. To study the effect of ADHD medication, we used stratified Cox regression to compare the risk of accidents during the medication period with the risk during the nonmedication period within the same patients. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Serious transport accident, identified as an emergency hospital visit or death due to transport accident. RESULTS Compared with individuals without ADHD, male patients with ADHD (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.47; 95% CI, 1.32-1.63) and female patients with ADHD (1.45; 1.24-1.71) had an increased risk of serious transport accidents. In male patients with ADHD, medication was associated with a 58% risk reduction (hazard ratio, 0.42; 95% CI, 0.23-0.75), but there was no statistically significant association in female patients. Estimates of the population-attributable fractions suggested that 41% to 49% of the accidents in male patients with ADHD could have been avoided if they had been receiving treatment during the entire follow-up. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder is associated with an increased risk of serious transport accidents, and this risk seems to be possibly reduced by ADHD medication, at least among male patients. This should lead to increased awareness among clinicians and patients of the association between serious transport accidents and ADHD medication.",,,"Chang, Z|D'Onofrio, BM|Larsson, H|Lichtenstein, P|Sjolander, A","Chang, Zheng|D'Onofrio, Brian M.|Larsson, Henrik|Lichtenstein, Paul|Sjolander, Arvid",319,-1,,,,,,,-1,,-1,,,,,,,,Article,10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2013.4174,,,,325,Clarivate Analytics Web of Science,,,,,,2168-622X,3,,,JAMA PSYCHIATRY,,,,DEFICIT-HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER|YOUNG-ADULTS|DOUBLE-BLIND|LISDEXAMFETAMINE DIMESYLATE|DRIVING PERFORMANCE|LIFE-SPAN|ADHD|DRIVERS|RISK|SAFETY,-1,"lichtenstein, paul/0000-0003-3037-5287; Larsson, Henrik/0000-0002-6851-3297",,,MAR,J,2014,,,,,,Psychiatry,,-1,,Psychiatry,,78,Serious Transport Accidents in Adults With Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder and the Effect of Medication A Population-Based Study,80,,WOS:000332769700014,1,71,2168-6238,24477798,C:\Users\mginda\Desktop\agc1\wos-extract.isi,"Chang Z, 2014, V71, P319, DOI 10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2013.4174"
"Large amounts of personal health data are being collected and made available through existing and emerging technological media and tools. While use of these data has significant potential to facilitate research, improve quality of care for individuals and populations, and reduce healthcare costs, many policy-related issues must be addressed before their full value can be realized. These include the need for widely agreed-on data stewardship principles and effective approaches to reduce or eliminate data silos and protect patient privacy.

Materials and methods We performed a review of studies describing systems or reporting techniques developed for identifying cohorts of patients with specific phenotypes. Every full text article published in (1) Journal of American Medical Informatics Association, (2) Journal of Biomedical Informatics, (3) Proceedings of the Annual American Medical Informatics Association Symposium, and (4) Proceedings of Clinical Research Informatics Conference within the past 3years was assessed for inclusion in the review. Only articles using automated techniques were included. Results Ninety-seven articles met our inclusion criteria. Forty-six used natural language processing (NLP)-based techniques, 24 described rule-based systems, 41 used statistical analyses, data mining, or machine learning techniques, while 22 described hybrid systems. Nine articles described the architecture of large-scale systems developed for determining cohort eligibility of patients. Discussion We observe that there is a rise in the number of studies associated with cohort identification using electronic medical records.

"Associations between low birth weight (<= 2,500 g) and increased risk of mortality and morbidity provided the foundation for the ""developmental origins of health and disease"" hypothesis. Previous between-family studies could not control for unmeasured confounders. Therefore, we compared differentially exposed siblings to estimate the extent to which the associations were due to uncontrolled factors. Our population cohort included 3,291,773 persons born in Sweden from 1973 to 2008. Analyses controlled for gestational age, among other covariates, and considered birth weight as both an ordinal and a continuous variable. Outcomes included mortality after 1 year, cardiac-related death, hypertension, ischemic heart disease, pulmonary circulation problems, stroke, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. We fitted fixed-effects models to compare siblings and conducted sensitivity analyses to test alternative explanations. Across the population, the lower the birth weight, the greater the risk of mortality (e. g., cardiac-related death (low birth weight hazard ratio = 2.69, 95% confidence interval: 2.05, 3.53)) and morbidity (e. g., type 2 diabetes mellitus (low birth weight hazard ratio = 1.79, 95% confidence interval: 1.50, 2.14)) outcomes in comparison with normal birth weight. All associations were independent of shared familial confounders and measured covariates.

"Background: Although detained youth evidence increased rates of mental illness, relatively few adolescents utilize mental health care upon release from detention. Thus, the goal of this study is to understand the process of mental health care engagement upon community reentry for mentally-ill detained youth. Methods: Qualitative interviews were conducted with 19 youth and caregiver dyads (39 participants) recruited from four Midwest counties affiliated with a state-wide mental health screening project. Previously detained youth (ages 11-17), who had elevated scores on a validated mental health screening measure, and a caregiver were interviewed 30 days post release. A critical realist perspective was used to identify themes on the detention and reentry experiences that impacted youth mental health care acquisition. Results: Youth perceived detention as a crisis event and having detention-based mental health care increased their motivation to seek mental health care at reentry. Caregivers described receiving very little information regarding their child during detention and felt ""out of the loop,"" which resulted in mental health care utilization difficulty. Upon community reentry, long wait periods between detention release and initial contact with court or probation officers were associated with decreased motivation for youth to seek care. However, systemic coordination between the family, court and mental health system facilitated mental health care connection. Conclusions: Utilizing mental health care services can be a daunting process, particularly for youth upon community reentry from detention. The current study illustrates that individual, family-specific and systemic issues interact to facilitate or impair mental health care utilization. As such, in order to aid youth in accessing mental health care at detention release, systemic coordination efforts are necessary. The systematic coordination among caregivers, youth, and individuals within the justice system are needed to reduce barriers given that utilization of mental health care is a complex process.",,,"Aalsma, MC|Brown, JR|Holloway, ED|Ott, MA","Aalsma, Matthew C.|Brown, James R.|Holloway, Evan D.|Ott, Mary A.",,-1,,,,,,,-1,,-1,,,,,,,,Article,10.1186/1471-2458-14-117,,,,,Clarivate Analytics Web of Science,,,,,,1471-2458,,,,BMC PUBLIC HEALTH,,,117,JUVENILE DETENTION|SCREENING INSTRUMENT|SERVICES|ADOLESCENTS|JUSTICE|FACILITIES|OFFENDERS|CLIENTS|MAYSI-2|COURT,-1,"Holloway, Evan/0000-0002-6888-8398",Juvenile justice|Detention|Mental health screening|Mental health care utilization|Qualitative research,,5-Feb,J,2014,,,,,,"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health",,-1,,"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health",,2,Connection to mental health care upon community reentry for detained youth: a qualitative study,2,,WOS:000331302800001,1,14,,24499325,C:\Users\mginda\Desktop\agc1\wos-extract.isi,"Aalsma MC, 2014, V14, DOI 10.1186/1471-2458-14-117"

"Methods We conducted a population-based cohort study via linkage of Swedish national and regional registers to investigate maternal pre-pregnancy BMI (underweight: BMI < 18.5; overweight: 25 BMI < 30; obesity: BMI epsilon 30) in relation to offspring ADHD. We followed 673 632 individuals born in Sweden between 1992 and 2000, with prospectively collected information on maternal pre-pregnancy BMI, until they received an ADHD diagnosis or ADHD medication, death, emigration or 31 December 2009. Hazard ratios (HRs) were estimated by Cox proportional hazards models. Stratified Cox proportional hazards models were applied to data on full siblings to control for unmeasured familial confounding. Results At the population level, pre-pregnancy overweight/obesity was associated with increased risk of offspring ADHD (HRoverweight = 1.23, 95% CI = 1.18-1.27, P = 0.01; HRobesity = 1.64, 95% CI = 1.57-1.73, P = 0.01), after adjustment for measured covariates.

"Mobile health (mHealth) technology has facilitated the transition of care beyond the traditional hospital setting to the homes of patients. Yet few studies have evaluated the legal implications of the expansion of mHealth applications, or ""apps."" Such apps are affected by a patchwork of policies related to medical licensure, privacy and security protection, and malpractice liability. For example, the privacy protections of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) of 1996 may apply to only some uses of the apps. Similarly, it is not clear what a doctor's malpractice liability would be if he or she injured a patient as the result of inaccurate information supplied by the patient's self-monitoring health app. This article examines the legal issues related to the oversight of health apps, discusses current federal regulations, and suggests strategies to improve the oversight of these apps.",,"chen, jing/D-8438-2014","Silverman, RD|Yang, YT","Silverman, Ross D.|Yang, Y.

"A strong therapeutic alliance has been shown to improve mental health treatment outcomes in adults, but this topic has not been fully explored with youth. Adolescents, particularly justice-involved youth, stand to benefit greatly from an improved treatment experience. One quality which can improve treatment is mental health providers' interpersonal skills when attempting to build a therapeutic rapport with adolescent clients. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 19 youth who screened positive for mental health concerns while in juvenile detention. Four themes were identified as important to improving the therapeutic alliance: Empathy, client-directed care, sequencing, and positive rapport.

"Background. Preconception, prenatal and postnatal maternal stress is associated with increased offspring psychopathology, but findings are inconsistent and need replication. We estimated associations between maternal bereavement stress and offspring autism spectrum disorder (ASD), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, suicide attempt and completed suicide. Method. Using Swedish registers, we conducted the largest population-based study to date examining associations between stress exposure in 738144 offspring born 1992-2000 for childhood outcomes and 2155221 offspring born 1973-1997 for adult outcomes with follow-up to 2009. Maternal stress was defined as death of a first-degree relative during (a) the 6 months before conception, (b) pregnancy or (c) the first two postnatal years. Cox proportional survival analyses were used to obtain hazard ratios (HRs) in unadjusted and adjusted analyses. Results. Marginal increased risk of bipolar disorder and schizophrenia following preconception bereavement stress was not significant. Third-trimester prenatal stress increased the risk of ASD [ adjusted HR (aHR) 1.58, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.15-2.17] and ADHD (aHR 1.31, 95% CI 1.04-1.66). First postnatal year stress increased the risk of offspring suicide attempt (aHR 1.13, 95% CI 1.02-1.25) and completed suicide (aHR 1.51, 95% CI 1.08-2.11). Bereavement stress during the second postnatal year increased the risk of ASD (aHR 1.30, 95% CI 1.09-1.55). Conclusions. Further research is needed regarding associations between preconception stress and psychopathological outcomes. Prenatal bereavement stress increases the risk of offspring ASD and ADHD. Postnatal bereavement stress moderately increases the risk of offspring suicide attempt, completed suicide and ASD. Smaller previous studies may have overestimated associations between early stress and psychopathological outcomes.",,,"Abel, KM|Class, QA|Dalman, C|D'Onofrio, BM|Hultman, CM|Khashan, AS|Langstorm, N|Larsson, H|Lichtenstein, P|Rickert, ME","Abel, K.

"Stigma is a barrier to HIV health seeking, but little is known about institutional and structural expressions of stigma in HIV testing. This study examines evidence of institutional and structural stigma in the HIV testing process. A qualitative, grounded theory study was conducted using secondary data from a 2011 HIV test site evaluation data in a Midwestern, moderate HIV incidence state. Expressions of structural and institutional stigma were found with over half of the testing sites and at three stages of the HIV testing visit. Examples of structural stigma included social geography, organization, and staff behavior at first encounter and reception, and staff behavior when experiencing the actual HIV test. Institutional stigma was socially expressed through staff behavior at entry/reception and when experiencing the HIV test. The emerging elements demonstrate the potential compounding of stigma experiences with deleterious effect. Study findings may inform future development of a theoretical framework. In practice, findings can guide organizations seeking to reduce HIV testing barriers, as they provide a window into how test seekers experience HIV test sites at first encounter, entry/reception, and at testing stages; and can identify how stigma might be intensified by structural and institutional expressions.",,,"Bailey, MM|Barnes, PR|Emetu, RE|Gillespie, A|Meyerson, BE|Ohmit, A","Bailey, Marlon M.|Barnes, Priscilla R.|Emetu, Roberta E.|Gillespie, Anthony|Meyerson, Beth E.|Ohmit, Anita",22,-1,,,,,,,-1,,-1,,,,,,,,Article,10.1089/apc.2013.0238,,,,27,Clarivate Analytics Web of Science,,,,,,1087-2914,1,,,AIDS PATIENT CARE AND STDS,,,,STIGMA|DISCRIMINATION|CARE,-1,,,,1-Jan,J,2014,,,,,,"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health|Infectious Diseases",,-1,,"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health; Infectious Diseases",,10,Institutional and Structural Barriers to HIV Testing: Elements for a Theoretical Framework,10,,WOS:000330808800005,1,28,1557-7449,24313812,C:\Users\mginda\Desktop\agc1\wos-extract.isi,"Meyerson B, 2014, V28, P22, DOI 10.1089/apc.2013.0238"
"Prenatal exposure to substances of abuse is associated with numerous psychological problems in offspring, but quasi-experimental studies controlling for co-occurring risk factors suggest that familial factors (e.g., genetic and environmental effects shared among siblings) confound many associations with maternal smoking during pregnancy (SDP). Few of the quasi-experimental studies in this area have explored normative psychological traits in early childhood or developmental changes across the lifespan, however. The current study used multilevel growth curve models with a large, nationally-representative sample in the United States to investigate for potential effects of SDP on the developmental trajectories of cognitive functioning, temperament/personality, and disruptive behavior across childhood, while accounting for shared familial confounds by comparing differentially exposed siblings and statistically controlling for offspring-specific covariates. Maternal SDP predicted the intercept (but not change over time) for all cognitive and externalizing outcomes. Accounting for familial confounds, however, attenuated the association between SDP exposure and all outcomes, except the intercept (age 5) for reading recognition. These findings, which are commensurate with previous quasi-experimental research on more severe indices of adolescent and adult problems, suggest that the associations between SDP and developmental traits in childhood are due primarily to confounding factors and not a causal association.",,,"D'Onofrio, BM|Ellingson, JM|Goodnight, JA|Van Hulle, CA|Waldman, ID","D'Onofrio, Brian M.|Ellingson, Jarrod M.|Goodnight, Jackson A.|Van Hulle, Carol A.|Waldman, Irwin D.",25,-1,,,,,,,-1,,-1,,,,,,,,Article,10.1007/s10519-013-9618-6,,,,35,Clarivate Analytics Web of Science,,,,,,0001-8244,1,,,BEHAVIOR GENETICS,,,,PRENATAL ALCOHOL EXPOSURE|MATERNAL SMOKING|CONDUCT PROBLEMS|EXTERNALIZING PROBLEMS|TWINS DESIGN|BEHAVIOR|CHILDREN|OUTCOMES|RISK|PSYCHOPATHOLOGY,-1,,Smoking during pregnancy|Childhood|Longitudinal|Sibling-comparison|Quasi experimental,,JAN,J,2014,,,,,,"Behavioral Sciences|Genetics & Heredity|Psychology, Multidisciplinary",,-1,,Behavioral Sciences; Genetics & Heredity; Psychology,,21,A Sibling-Comparison Study of Smoking During Pregnancy and Childhood Psychological Traits,21,,WOS:000330618000003,1,44,1573-3297,24085497,C:\Users\mginda\Desktop\agc1\wos-extract.isi,"Ellingson JM, 2014, V44, P25, DOI 10.1007/s10519-013-9618-6"
"BackgroundCrossed high-alcohol-preferring (cHAP) mice were selectively bred from a cross of the HAP1xHAP2 replicate lines and demonstrate blood ethanol concentrations (BECs) during free-choice drinking reminiscent of those observed in alcohol-dependent humans. In this report, we investigated the relationship between free-choice drinking, intoxication, tolerance, and sensitization in cHAP mice. We hypothesized that initially mice would become ataxic after drinking alcohol, but that increased drinking over days would be accompanied by increasing tolerance to the ataxic effects of ethanol (EtOH). MethodsMale and female cHAP mice had free-choice access to 10% EtOH and water (E), while Water mice (W) had access to water alone. In experiment 1, the first drinking experience was monitored during the dark portion of the cycle. Once E mice reached an average intake rate of 1.5g/kg/h, they, along with W mice, were tested for footslips on a balance beam, and BECs were assessed. In experiments 2, 3, and 4, after varying durations of free-choice 10% EtOH access (0, 3, 14, or 21days), mice were challenged with 20% EtOH and tested for number of footslips on a balance beam or locomotor stimulant response. Blood was sampled for BEC determination. ResultsWe found that cHAP mice rapidly acquire alcohol intakes that lead to ataxia. Over time, cHAP mice developed behavioral tolerance to the ataxic effects of alcohol, paralleled by escalating alcohol consumption. However, locomotor sensitization did not develop following 14days of free-choice EtOH access. ConclusionsOverall, we observed increases in free-choice drinking with extended alcohol access paralleled by increases in functional tolerance, but not locomotor sensitization. These data support our hypothesis that escalating free-choice drinking over days in cHAP mice is driven by tolerance to alcohol's behavioral effects. These data are the first to demonstrate that escalating free-choice consumption is accompanied by increasing alcohol tolerance. In addition to buttressing the hypothesized importance of tolerance in drinking, our findings suggest that cHAP mice may be a unique, translational resource for studying tolerance as a contributor to and consequence of chronic, excessive EtOH consumption.",,,"Boehm, SL|Grahame, NJ|Kasten, CR|Matson, LM","Boehm, Stephen L., II|Grahame, Nicholas J.|Kasten, Chelsea R.|Matson, Liana M.",267,-1,,,,,,,-1,,-1,,,,,,,,Article,10.1111/acer.12216,,,,274,Clarivate Analytics Web of Science,,,,,,0145-6008,1,,,ALCOHOLISM-CLINICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL RESEARCH,,,,DBA/2J MICE|STIMULANT|RATS|SENSITIVITY|PREFERENCE|ADDICTION|C57BL/6J|DURATION|CONTEXT|MODEL,-1,"Kasten, Chelsea/0000-0002-6502-1051",Alcohol Consumption|Rodent Model|Motor Ataxia|Tolerance|Selected Line,,JAN,J,2014,,,,,,Substance Abuse,,-1,,Substance Abuse,,12,"Selectively Bred Crossed High-Alcohol-Preferring Mice Drink to Intoxication and Develop Functional Tolerance, But Not Locomotor Sensitization During Free-Choice Ethanol Access",12,,WOS:000329885900032,1,38,1530-0277,23909817,C:\Users\mginda\Desktop\agc1\wos-extract.isi,"Matson LM, 2014, V38, P267, DOI 10.1111/acer.12216"
"BackgroundMaternal Smoking During Pregnancy (SDP) has consistently been associated with increased risk of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in offspring, but recent studies indicate that this association might be due to unmeasured familial confounding. MethodsA total of 813,030 individuals born in Sweden between 1992 and 2000 were included in this nationwide population-based cohort study. Data on maternal SDP and ADHD diagnosis were obtained from national registers and patients were followed up from the age of 3 to the end of 2009. Hazard Ratios (HRs) were estimated using stratified Cox regression models. Cousin and sibling data were used to control for unmeasured familial confounding. ResultsAt the population level maternal SDP predicted ADHD in offspring (HRModerateSDP=1.89; HRHighSDP=2.50). This estimate gradually attenuated toward the null when adjusting for measured confounders (HRModerateSDP=1.62; HRHighSDP=2.04), unmeasured confounders shared within the extended family (i.e., cousin comparison) (HRModerateSDP=1.45; HRHighSDP=1.69), and unmeasured confounders within the nuclear family (i.e., sibling comparison) (HRModerateSDP=0.88; HRHighSDP=0.84).

"Understanding the role of socio-sexual cognitions and religiosity on adolescent sexual behavior could guide adolescent sexual health efforts. The present study utilized longitudinal data from 328 young women to assess the role of religion and socio-sexual cognitions on sexual behavior accrual (measuring both coital and non-coital sexual behavior). In the final triple conditional trajectory structural equation model, religiosity declined over time and then increased to baseline levels. Additionally, religiosity predicted decreased sexual conservatism and decreased sexual conservatism predicted increased sexual behavior. The final models are indicative of young women's increasing accrual of sexual experience, decreasing sexual conservatism and initial decreasing religiosity. The results of this study suggest that decreased religiosity affects the accrual of sexual experience through decreased sexual conservatism. Effective strategies of sexual health promotion should include an understanding of the complex role of socio-sexual attitudes with religiosity.

Differences in demographic characteristics were compared among individuals with fills at 30- or 90-days and those with no medication fills. Forty-five percent of patients were on at least one psychiatric medication. Among detainees on a psychiatric medication, 62 % had a fill by 30 days after release, and 78 % by 90 days. At least 50 % of the adolescents on a psychiatric medication were on an atypical antipsychotic. There was no significant relationship between medication fill and race, age, or sex.

"Background: Various forms of community disorder are associated with health outcomes but little is known about how dynamic context where an adolescent spends time relates to her health-related behaviors. Objective: Assess whether exposure to contexts associated with crime (as a marker of community disorder) correlates with self-reported health-related behaviors among adolescent girls. Methods: Girls (N = 52), aged 14-17, were recruited from a single geographic urban area and monitored for 1 week using a GPS-enabled cell phone. Adolescents completed an audio computer-assisted self-administered interview survey on substance use (cigarette, alcohol, or marijuana use) and sexual intercourse in the last 30 days. In addition to recorded home and school address, phones transmitted location data every 5 minutes (path points). Using ArcGIS, we defined community disorder as aggregated point-level Unified Crime Report data within a 200-meter Euclidian buffer from home, school and each path point. Using Stata, we analyzed how exposures to areas of higher crime prevalence differed among girls who reported each behavior or not. Results: Participants lived and spent time in areas with variable crime prevalence within 200 meters of their home, school and path points. Significant differences in exposure occurred based on home location among girls who reported any substance use or not (p 0.04) and sexual intercourse or not (p 0.01). Differences in exposure by school and path points were only significant among girls reporting any substance use or not (p 0.03 and 0.02, respectively). Exposure also varied by school/ non-school day as well as time of day. Conclusions: Adolescent travel patterns are not random. Furthermore, the crime context where an adolescent spends time relates to her health-related behavior.

"Objective To assess the feasibility, readiness, and acceptability of offering rapid human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) testing in community pharmacies. Design: Qualitative study. Setting: Community pharmacies in Indiana from May to September 2012. Participants: 17 licensed community pharmacists. Intervention: Semistructured interviews among a convenience sample of community pharmacists. Main outcome measures: Community pharmacists' self-reported attitudes toward rapid HIV testing in community pharmacies, perceptions of peer acceptability, and opinions about readiness for implementation of the practice in community pharmacies. Results: Participants accepted the idea of pharmacy-based REV testing, describing it as accessible, convenient, and nonstigmatizing. Acceptability was closely linked to positive patient relationships and pharmacist comfort with consultation. Identified challenges to pharmacy-based HIV testing included staffing issues, uneasiness with delivering positive test results, lack of information needed to link patients to care, insufficient consulting space, and need for additional training. Participants indicated that peer beliefs about the acceptability of pharmacist-based HIV testing would vary but that more recently trained pharmacists likely would be more accepting of the practice. Conclusion: Most participants felt that offering HIV testing was a reasonable addition to the evolving role of the community pharmacist, pending resolution of personal and institutional barriers.",,,"Coy, KC|Meyerson, BE|Ryder, PT|von Hippel, CDJ","Coy, Kelsey C.|Meyerson, Beth E.|Ryder, Priscilla T.|von Hippel, Christiana D.

"IMPORTANCE Preterm birth is associated with increased mortality and morbidity. However, previous studies have been unable to rigorously examine whether confounding factors cause these associations rather than the harmful effects of being born preterm. OBJECTIVE To estimate the extent to which the associations between early gestational age and offspring mortality and morbidity are the result of confounding factors by using a quasi-experimental design, the sibling-comparison approach, and by controlling for statistical covariates that varied within families. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A population-based cohort study, combining Swedish registries to identify all individuals born in Sweden from 1973 to 2008 (3 300 708 offspring of 1 736 735 mothers) and link them with multiple outcomes. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Offspring mortality (during infancy and throughout young adulthood) and psychiatric (psychotic or bipolar disorder, autism, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, suicide attempts, substance use, and criminality), academic (failing grades and educational attainment), and social (partnering, parenthood, low income, and social welfare benefits) outcomes through 2009. RESULTS In the population, there was a dose-response relationship between early gestation and the outcome measures. For example, extreme preterm birth (23-27 weeks of gestation) was associated with infant mortality (odds ratio, 288.1; 95% CI, 271.7-305.5), autism (hazard ratio [HR], 3.2; 95% CI, 2.6-4.0), low educational attainment (HR, 1.7; 1.5-2.0), and social welfare benefits (HR, 1.3; 1.2-1.5) compared with offspring born at term. The associations between early gestation and mortality and psychiatric morbidity generally were robust when comparing differentially exposed siblings and controlling for statistical covariates, whereas the associations with academic and some social problems were greatly or completely attenuated in the fixed-effects models. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The mechanisms responsible for the associations between preterm birth and mortality and morbidity are outcome-specific. Associations between preterm birth and mortality and psychiatric morbidity are largely independent of shared familial confounds and measured covariates, consistent with a causal inference. However, some associations, particularly predicting suicide attempt, educational attainment, and social welfare benefits, are the result of confounding factors. The findings emphasize the importance of both reducing preterm birth and providing wraparound services to all siblings in families with an offspring born preterm.",,,"Class, QA|D'Onofrio, BM|Langstorm, N|Larsson, H|Lichtenstein, P|Rickert, ME","Class, Quetzal A.|D'Onofrio, Brian M.|Langstorm, Niklas|Larsson, Henrik|Lichtenstein, Paul|Rickert, Martin",1231,-1,,,,,,,-1,,-1,,,,,,,,Article,10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2013.2107,,,,1240,Clarivate Analytics Web of Science,,,,,,2168-622X,11,,,JAMA PSYCHIATRY,,,,SWEDISH NATIONAL COHORT|MATERNAL SMOKING|RISK-FACTORS|GESTATIONAL-AGE|SOCIOECONOMIC ACHIEVEMENTS|PSYCHIATRIC-DISORDER|BEHAVIORAL OUTCOMES|BIPOLAR DISORDER|INDIVIDUALS BORN|YOUNG ADULTHOOD,-1,"Larsson, Henrik/0000-0002-6851-3297; lichtenstein, paul/0000-0003-3037-5287",,,NOV,J,2013,,,,,,Psychiatry,,-1,,Psychiatry,,94,Preterm Birth and Mortality and Morbidity A Population-Based Quasi-experimental Study,94,,WOS:000328948700016,1,70,2168-6238,24068297,C:\Users\mginda\Desktop\agc1\wos-extract.isi,"D'Onofrio BM, 2013, V70, P1231, DOI 10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2013.2107"

"Sensitization to the locomotor stimulant effects of alcohol (ethanol) is thought to be a heritable risk factor for the development of alcoholism that reflects progressive increases in the positive motivational effects of this substance. However, very little is known about the degree to which genes influence this complex behavioral phenomenon. The primary goal of this work was to determine the heritability of ethanol-induced locomotor sensitization in mice using short-term behavioral selection. Genetically heterogeneous C57BL/6J (B6) x DBA/2J (D2) F2 mice were generated from B6D2F1 progenitors, phenotyped for the expression of locomotor sensitization, and bred for high (HLS) and low (LLS) expression of this behavior. Selective breeding was conducted in two independently generated replicate sets to increase the confidence of our heritability estimates and for future correlated trait analyses. Large and significant differences in locomotor sensitization between HLS and LLS lines were evident by the fourth generation. Twenty-two percent of the observed line difference(s) were attributable to genes (h (2) = .22). Interestingly, locomotor activity in the absence of ethanol was genetically correlated with ethanol sensitization; high activity was associated with high sensitization. That changes in ethanol sensitivity following repeated exposures are genetically regulated highlights the relevance of studies aimed at determining how genes regulate susceptibility to ethanol-induced behavioral and neural adaptations. As alcohol use and abuse disorders develop following many repeated alcohol exposures, these data emphasize the need for future studies determining the genetic basis by which changes in response to alcohol occur.",,,"Boehm, SL|Linsenbardt, DN","Boehm, Stephen L., II|Linsenbardt, David N.",267,-1,,,,,,,-1,,-1,,,,,,,,Article,10.1007/s00213-013-3151-4,,,,278,Clarivate Analytics Web of Science,,,,,,0033-3158,2,,,PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY,,,,RECOMBINANT INBRED MICE|CONDITIONED PLACE PREFERENCE|ALCOHOL DEPENDENCE RISK|CHRONIC TOLERANCE|PROBLEM DRINKING|NOVELTY SEEKING|RATS|ADDICTION|RESPONSES|SONS,-1,,Alcohol|Ethanol|Mouse|Sensitization|Locomotor|Heritability|Selective breeding|Behavior,,NOV,J,2013,,,,,,Neurosciences|Pharmacology & Pharmacy|Psychiatry,,-1,,Neurosciences & Neurology; Pharmacology & Pharmacy; Psychiatry,,3,Determining the heritability of ethanol-induced locomotor sensitization in mice using short-term behavioral selection,3,,WOS:000326117800009,1,230,1432-2072,23732838,C:\Users\mginda\Desktop\agc1\wos-extract.isi,"Linsenbardt DN, 2013, V230, P267, DOI 10.1007/s00213-013-3151-4"
"Researchers have identified environmental risks that predict subsequent psychological and medical problems. Based on these correlational findings, researchers have developed and tested complex developmental models and have examined biological moderating factors (e.g., gene-environment interactions). In this context, we stress the critical need for researchers to use family-based, quasi-experimental designs when trying to integrate genetic and social science research involving environmental variables because these designs rigorously examine causal inferences by testing competing hypotheses. We argue that sibling comparison, offspring of twins or siblings, in vitro fertilization designs, and other genetically informed approaches play a unique role in bridging gaps between basic biological and social science research. We use studies on maternal smoking during pregnancy to exemplify these principles.",,,"D'Onofrio, BM|Lahey, BB|Lichtenstein, P|Turkheimer, E","D'Onofrio, Brian M.|Lahey, Benjamin B.|Lichtenstein, Paul|Turkheimer, Eric",46,-1,,,,,,,-1,,-1,,,,,,,,Article,10.2105/AJPH.2013.301252,,,,55,Clarivate Analytics Web of Science,,,,,,0090-0036,,,,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH,,,,NATIONAL LONGITUDINAL SURVEY|MATERNAL-SMOKING|ENVIRONMENT INTERACTION|ANTISOCIAL-BEHAVIOR|CIGARETTE-SMOKING|PRENATAL SMOKING|RISK-FACTOR|TRANSLATIONAL EPIDEMIOLOGY|DEVELOPMENTAL CASCADES|ACADEMIC-ACHIEVEMENT,-1,"lichtenstein, paul/0000-0003-3037-5287",,,OCT,J,2013,,,,,,"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health",,-1,,"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health",1,112,"Critical Need for Family-Based, Quasi-Experimental Designs in Integrating Genetic and Social Science Research",112,,WOS:000331071600011,1,103,1541-0048,23927516,C:\Users\mginda\Desktop\agc1\wos-extract.isi,"D'Onofrio BM, 2013, V103, P46, DOI 10.2105/AJPH.2013.301252"

"Purpose: Teenage childbirth is associated with poor psychosocial outcomes for teen mothers. One example is that teen mothers have higher rates of antisocial behavior. The extant research has riot been able to determine if teenage motherhood is independently associated with criminal behavior, or if the association is due to selection factors associated with both teenage childbirth and criminal behavior. Methods: We used longitudinal data from Swedish national registers and sibling-comparisons (both full- and half-siblings) to identify the extent to which there is an independent association between teenage childbirth and mothers' likelihood of criminal conviction between ages 20-30, or if the association is confounded by familial (including genetic or environmental) factors that make sisters similar. Results: Women who began childbearing as teenagers were more likely to be convicted of a crime in young adulthood compared to women who delayed childbearing. When sisters were compared, the association between teenage childbirth and criminal convictions disappeared. Multivariate behavior genetic analyses suggest genetic and shared environmental account for the association. Conclusions: The statistical association between teenage childbirth and early adulthood criminal convictions is confounded by genetic and shared environmental factors that influence both the likelihood of teenage childbirth and risk of early adulthood criminal conviction.

"BACKGROUND: Preventative health services, including herpes zoster vaccination rates, remain low despite known benefits. A new care model to improve preventative health services is warranted. The objective of this study is to investigate whether the functions of an electronic medical record, in combination with a pharmacist as part of the care team, can improve the herpes zoster vaccination rate. METHODS: This study was a 6-month, randomized controlled trial at a General Internal Medicine clinic at The Ohio State University. The 2589 patients aged 60 years and older without documented herpes zoster vaccination in the electronic medical record were stratified on the basis of activated personal health record status, an online tool used to share health information between patient and provider. Of the 674 personal health record users, 250 were randomized to receive information regarding the herpes zoster vaccination via an electronic message and 424 were randomized to standard of care. Likewise, of the 1915 nonpersonal health record users, 250 were randomized to receive the same information via the US Postal Service and 1665 were randomized to standard of care. After pharmacist chart review, eligible patients were mailed a herpes zoster vaccine prescription. Herpes zoster vaccination rates were compared by chi-square tests. RESULTS: Intervention recipients had significantly higher vaccination rates than controls in both personal health record (relative risk, 2.7; P = .0007) and nonpersonal health record (relative risk, 2.9; P = .0001) patient populations. CONCLUSIONS: Communication outside of face-to-face office visits, by both personal health record electronic message and information by mail, can improve preventative health intervention rates compared with standard care.

The impact of religiosity in adolescent romantic partnerships on sexual behavior was assessed. Data were obtained from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health reciprocated couples database using religious- and relationship-oriented variables to predict sexual involvement in 374 couples (748 participants). We found that individual- and couple-based religiosity impacted sexual behavior. These findings provide evidence for dyad religiosity as a component involved in the expression of sexual behavior in romantic relationships. The current results highlight the importance of incorporating a broad social perspective in order to understand the expression of adolescent sexual behavior.,,,"Aalsma, MC|Azzouz, F|Fortenberry, JD|LeJeune, BC|Zimet, GD","Aalsma, Matthew C.|Azzouz, Faouzi|Fortenberry, J.

"Background: As clinical data are increasingly collected and stored electronically, their potential use for comparative effectiveness research (CER) grows. Despite this promise, challenges face those wishing to leverage such data. In this paper we aim to enumerate some of the knowledge management and informatics issues common to such data reuse. Design: After reviewing the current state of knowledge regarding biomedical informatics challenges and best practices related to CER, we then present 2 research projects at our institution. We analyze these and highlight several common themes and challenges related to the conduct of CER studies. Finally, we represent these emergent themes. Results: The informatics challenges commonly encountered by those conducting CER studies include issues related to data information and knowledge management (eg, data reuse, data preparation) as well as those related to people and organizational issues (eg, sociotechnical factors and organizational factors). Examples of these are described in further detail and a formal framework for describing these findings is presented. Conclusions: Significant challenges face researchers attempting to use often diverse and heterogeneous datasets for CER. These challenges must be understood in order to be dealt with successfully and can often be overcome with the appropriate use of informatics best practices. Many research and policy questions remain to be answered in order to realize the full potential of the increasingly electronic clinical data available for such research.",,"Hebert, Courtney/G-4900-2016; Embi, Peter/E-3030-2011","Embi, PJ|Gordillo, G|Hebert, C|Kelleher, K|Payne, PRO","Embi, Peter J.|Gordillo, Gayle|Hebert, Courtney|Kelleher, Kelly|Payne, Philip R.

"Accelerating clinical and translational science and improving healthcare effectiveness, quality, and efficiency are top priorities for the United States. Increasingly, the success of such initiatives relies on leveraging point-of-care activities, data, and resources to generate evidence through routine practice. At present, leveraging healthcare activities to advance knowledge is challenging. Underlying these challenges are a variety of persistent technological, regulatory, fiscal, and socio-organizational realities. Fundamentally, these result from the fact that the current healthcare system is designed around a paradigm that enables individual patient care and views the connection between research and practice as unidirectional (ie, research findings are applied to practice using evidence-based medicine) but does not support research-related activities during practice. We suggest that a fundamental paradigm shift is needed to redefine the relationship between research and practice as bidirectional rather than unidirectional and propose the concept of evidence generating medicine to provide a framework for realizing such a shift. We discuss how a transition toward evidence generating medicine would result in a range of much-needed system-level changes that would facilitate rather than frustrate the ongoing efforts of informaticians, health services researchers, and others working to accelerate research and improve healthcare.",,"Embi, Peter/E-3030-2011","Embi, PJ|Payne, PRO","Embi, Peter J.|Payne, Philip R.

"Background A number of studies suggest associations between neighbourhood characteristics and criminality during adolescence and young adulthood. However, the causality of such neighbourhood effects remains uncertain. Methods We followed all children born in Sweden from 1975-1989 who lived in its three largest cities by the age of 15 years and for whom complete information was available about individual and contextual factors (N = 303 465). All biological siblings were identified in the sample (N = 179 099). Generalized linear mixed-effects models were used to assess the effect of neighbourhood deprivation on violent criminality and substance misuse between the ages of 15 and 20 years, while taking into account the cross-classified data structure (i.e. siblings in the same families attending different schools and living in different neighbourhoods at age 15). Results In the crude model, an increase of 1 SD in neighbourhood deprivation was associated with a 57% increase in the odds of being convicted of a violent crime (95% CI 52%-63%). The effect was greatly attenuated when adjustment was made for a number of observed confounders (OR 1.09, 95% CI 1.06-1.11). When we additionally adjusted for unobserved familial confounders, the effect was no longer present (OR 0.96, 95% CI 0.84-1.10). Similar results were observed for substance misuse. The results were not due to poor variability either between neighbourhoods or within families. Conclusions We found that the adverse effect of neighbourhood deprivation on adolescent violent criminality and substance misuse in Sweden was not consistent with a causal inference. Instead, our findings highlight the need to control for familial confounding in multilevel studies of criminality and substance misuse.",,,"D'Onofrio, BM|Franck, J|Hallqvist, J|Langstorm, N|Lichtenstein, P|Sariaslan, A","D'Onofrio, Brian M.|Franck, Johan|Hallqvist, Johan|Langstorm, Niklas|Lichtenstein, Paul|Sariaslan, Amir",1057,-1,,,,,,,-1,,-1,,,,,,,,Article,10.1093/ije/dyt066,,,,1066,Clarivate Analytics Web of Science,,,,,,0300-5771,4,,,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY,,,,MULTILEVEL ANALYSIS|SOCIAL EPIDEMIOLOGY|CAUSAL INFERENCE|ENVIRONMENTAL-INFLUENCES|MOBILITY EXPERIMENT|HEALTH|SWEDEN|CRIME|WORLD|ASSOCIATION,-1,"lichtenstein, paul/0000-0003-3037-5287",Violence|substance-related disorders|residence characteristics|socio-economic factors|multi-level analysis|confounding factors,,AUG,J,2013,,,,,,"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health",,-1,,"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health",,22,"The impact of neighbourhood deprivation on adolescent violent criminality and substance misuse: A longitudinal, quasi-experimental study of the total Swedish population",22,,WOS:000325167800021,1,42,1464-3685,24062294,C:\Users\mginda\Desktop\agc1\wos-extract.isi,"Sariaslan A, 2013, V42, P1057, DOI 10.1093/ije/dyt066"
"With over 1 million children in the United States affected by parental divorce or separation each year, there is interest in interventions to mitigate the potential negative consequences of divorce on children. Family mediation has been widely heralded as a better solution than litigation; however, mediation does not work for all families. One proposed improvement involves bringing the child's perspective to mediation, to motivate parents to create better agreements. In this randomized controlled trial, we compared new child-informed forms of mediation against a mediation-as-usual (MAU) control condition. In child-focused (CF) mediation, parents are presented with general information about children and divorce; in child-inclusive (CI) mediation, the child(ren) are interviewed and parents are provided with feedback about their specific case. Given the similar focus and goals of CF and CI, main study analyses compared a combined CF and CI group (n = 47) to 22 MAU cases. The CF and CI interventions had a positive effect on mediation outcomes relative to MAU (e.g., parents were more likely to report learning something useful, and mediators wanted their cases to be CF and CI). Cases in CF and CI reached comparable rates of agreement as cases in MAU, but CF and CI agreements included more parenting time for nonresidential parents, and were more likely to include provisions for coparental communication and provisions assumed to be better for child outcomes. Study results are encouraging and should provide support for wider program evaluation efforts to continue refining the CI and CF interventions.",,,"Applegate, AG|Ballard, RH|Bates, JE|D'Onofrio, BM|Holtzworth-Munroe, A","Applegate, Amy G.|Ballard, Robin H.|Bates, John E.|D'Onofrio, Brian M.|Holtzworth-Munroe, Amy",271,-1,,,,,,,-1,,-1,,,,,,,,Article,10.1037/a0033274,,,,281,Clarivate Analytics Web of Science,,,,,,1076-8971,3,,,PSYCHOLOGY PUBLIC POLICY AND LAW,,,,DIVORCE|ADJUSTMENT|PERSPECTIVES|CUSTODY|THERAPY,-1,,divorce|divorce mediation|child-focused mediation|child-inclusive mediation|randomized controlled trial,,AUG,J,2013,,,,,,"Health Policy & Services|Law|Psychology, Multidisciplinary",,-1,,Health Care Sciences & Services; Government & Law; Psychology,,10,A Randomized Controlled Trial of Child-Informed Mediation,10,,WOS:000322918900001,1,19,1939-1528,,C:\Users\mginda\Desktop\agc1\wos-extract.isi,"Ballard RH, 2013, V19, P271, DOI 10.1037/a0033274"

"Although preconception and prenatal maternal stress are associated with adverse outcomes in birth and childhood, their relation to infant mortality remains uncertain. We used logistic regression to study infant mortality risk following maternal stress within a population-based sample of infants born in Sweden between 1973 and 2008 (N = 3,055,361). Preconception (6-0 months before conception) and prenatal (between conception and birth) stress were defined as death of a first-degree relative of the mother. A total of 20,651 offspring were exposed to preconception stress, 26,731 offspring were exposed to prenatal stress, and 8,398 cases of infant mortality were identified. Preconception stress increased the risk of infant mortality independently of measured covariates, and this association was timing specific and robust across low-risk groups. Prenatal stress did not increase risk of infant mortality. These results suggest that the period immediately before conception may be a sensitive developmental period with ramifications for infant mortality risk.",,,"Class, QA|D'Onofrio, BM|Khashan, AS|Langstorm, N|Lichtenstein, P","Class, Quetzal A.|D'Onofrio, Brian M.|Khashan, Ali S.|Langstorm, Niklas|Lichtenstein, Paul",1309,-1,,,,,,,-1,,-1,,,,,,,,Article,10.1177/0956797612468010,,,,1316,Clarivate Analytics Web of Science,,,,,,0956-7976,7,,,PSYCHOLOGICAL SCIENCE,,,,DEATH-SYNDROME|LIFE EVENTS|PREGNANCY|RISK|BEREAVEMENT|STILLBIRTH|OUTCOMES|PRETERM|COHORT|CARE,-1,"lichtenstein, paul/0000-0003-3037-5287",preconception|prenatal|maternal stress|bereavement|infant mortality|infant development|stress reactions|health,,JUL,J,2013,,,,,,"Psychology, Multidisciplinary",,-1,,Psychology,,24,Maternal Stress and Infant Mortality: The Importance of the Preconception Period,25,,WOS:000321702500028,1,24,,23653129,C:\Users\mginda\Desktop\agc1\wos-extract.isi,"Class QA, 2013, V24, P1309, DOI 10.1177/0956797612468010"
"Objective Clinical documentation is central to the medical record and so to a range of healthcare and business processes. As electronic health record adoption expands, computerized provider documentation (CPD) is increasingly the primary means of capturing clinical documentation. Previous CPD studies have focused on particular stakeholder groups and sites, often limiting their scope and conclusions. To address this, we studied multiple stakeholder groups from multiple sites across the USA. Methods We conducted 14 focus groups at five Department of Veterans Affairs facilities with 129 participants (54 physicians or practitioners, 34 nurses, and 37 administrators). Investigators qualitatively analyzed resultant transcripts, developed categories linked to the data, and identified emergent themes. Results Five major themes related to CPD emerged: communication and coordination; control and limitations in expressivity; information availability and reasoning support; workflow alteration and disruption; and trust and confidence concerns. The results highlight that documentation intertwines tightly with clinical and administrative workflow. Perceptions differed between the three stakeholder groups but remained consistent within groups across facilities. Conclusions CPD has dramatically changed documentation processes, impacting clinical understanding, decision-making, and communication across multiple groups. The need for easy and rapid, yet structured and constrained, documentation often conflicts with the need for highly reliable and retrievable information to support clinical reasoning and workflows. Current CPD systems, while better than paper overall, often do not meet the needs of users, partly because they are based on an outdated 'paper-chart' paradigm. These findings should inform those implementing CPD systems now and future plans for more effective CPD systems.",,"Embi, Peter/E-3030-2011","Efthimiadis, EN|Embi, PJ|Hammond, KW|Hedeen, AN|Thielke, SM|Weir, CR","Efthimiadis, Efthimis N.|Embi, Peter J.|Hammond, Kenric W.|Hedeen, Ashley N.|Thielke, Stephen M.|Weir, Charlene R.",718,-1,,,,,,,-1,,-1,,,,,,,,Article,10.1136/amiajnl-2012-000946,,,,726,Clarivate Analytics Web of Science,,,,,,1067-5027,4,,,JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MEDICAL INFORMATICS ASSOCIATION,,,,PHYSICIAN ORDER ENTRY|ELECTRONIC PATIENT RECORD|ACADEMIC MEDICAL-CENTER|HEALTH-CARE|INFORMATION-TECHNOLOGY|IMPACT|PERCEPTIONS|HOSPITALS|RESIDENT|FACULTY,-1,,,,JUL,J,2013,,,,,,"Computer Science, Information Systems|Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications|Health Care Sciences & Services|Information Science & Library Science|Medical Informatics",,-1,,Computer Science; Health Care Sciences & Services; Information Science & Library Science; Medical Informatics,,16,Computerized provider documentation: findings and implications of a multisite study of clinicians and administrators,16,,WOS:000320168600018,1,20,1527-974X,23355462,C:\Users\mginda\Desktop\agc1\wos-extract.isi,"Embi PJ, 2013, V20, P718, DOI 10.1136/amiajnl-2012-000946"

"Teenage motherhood is associated with poor offspring outcomes but these associations may be influenced by offspring birth year because of substantial social changes in recent decades. Existing research also has not examined whether these associations are due to the specific effect of mother's age at childbirth or factors shared by siblings in a family. We used a population-based cohort study in Sweden comprising all children born from 1960 to 1989 (N = 3,162,239), and a subsample of siblings differentially exposed to maternal teenage childbearing (N = 485,259) to address these limitations. We examined the effect of teenage childbearing on offspring violent and non-violent criminal convictions, poor academic performance, and substance-related problems. Population-wide teenage childbearing was associated with offspring criminal convictions, poor academic performance, and substance-related problems. The magnitude of these associations increased over time. Comparisons of differentially exposed siblings indicated no within-family association between teenage childbearing and offspring violent and non-violent criminal convictions or poor academic performance, although offspring born to teenage mothers were more likely to experience substance-related problems than their later-born siblings. Being born to a teenage mother in Sweden has become increasingly associated with negative outcomes across time, but the nature of this association may differ by outcome. Teenage childbearing may be associated with offspring violent and non-violent criminal convictions and poor academic performance because of shared familial risk factors, but may be causally associated with offspring substance-related problems. The findings suggest that interventions to improve offspring outcomes should delay teenage childbearing and also target risk factors influencing all offspring of teenage mothers.",,,"Coyne, CA|D'Onofrio, BM|Langstorm, N|Lichtenstein, P","Coyne, Claire A.|D'Onofrio, Brian M.|Langstorm, Niklas|Lichtenstein, Paul",679,-1,,,,,,,-1,,-1,,,,,,,,Article,10.1017/thg.2013.23,,,,689,Clarivate Analytics Web of Science,,,,,,1832-4274,3,,,TWIN RESEARCH AND HUMAN GENETICS,,,,ADOLESCENT PREGNANCY|DEVELOPED-COUNTRIES|VIOLENT CRIME|YOUNG MOTHERS|MATERNAL AGE|BEHAVIOR|CHILDREN|HYPOTHESES|CHILDBIRTH|HEALTH,-1,"lichtenstein, paul/0000-0003-3037-5287",teenage childbearing|teenage motherhood|criminal behavior|substance use|academic attainment|academic achievement,,JUN,J,2013,,,,,,Genetics & Heredity|Obstetrics & Gynecology,,-1,,Genetics & Heredity; Obstetrics & Gynecology,,9,The Association Between Teenage Motherhood and Poor Offspring Outcomes: A National Cohort Study Across 30 Years,9,,WOS:000319127400004,1,16,,23632141,C:\Users\mginda\Desktop\agc1\wos-extract.isi,"Coyne CA, 2013, V16, P679, DOI 10.1017/thg.2013.23"
"Prior studies have suggested, but not fully established, that language ability is important for regulating attention and behavior. Language ability may have implications for understanding attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and conduct disorders, as well as subclinical problems. This article reports findings from two longitudinal studies to test (a) whether language ability has an independent effect on behavior problems, and (b) the direction of effect between language ability and behavior problems. In Study 1 (N = 585), language ability was measured annually from ages 7 to 13 years by language subtests of standardized academic achievement tests administered at the children's schools. Inattentive-hyperactive (I-H) and externalizing (EXT) problems were reported annually by teachers and mothers. In Study 2 (N = 11,506), language ability (receptive vocabulary) and mother-rated I-H and EXT problems were measured biannually from ages 4 to 12 years. Analyses in both studies showed that language ability predicted within-individual variability in the development of I-H and EXT problems over and above the effects of sex, ethnicity, socioeconomic status (SES), and performance in other academic and intellectual domains (e.g., math, reading comprehension, reading recognition, and short-term memory [STM]). Even after controls for prior levels of behavior problems, language ability predicted later behavior problems more strongly than behavior problems predicted later language ability, suggesting that the direction of effect may be from language ability to behavior problems. The findings suggest that language ability may be a useful target for the prevention or even treatment of attention deficits and EXT problems in children.",,"Petersen, Isaac/H-5568-2018","Bates, JE|Coyne, CA|Dodge, KA|D'Onofrio, BM|Lansford, JE|Petersen, IT|Pettit, GS|Van Hulle, CA","Bates, John E.|Coyne, Claire A.|Dodge, Kenneth A.|D'Onofrio, Brian M.|Lansford, Jennifer E.|Petersen, Isaac T.|Pettit, Gregory S.|Van Hulle, Carol A.",542,-1,,,,,,,-1,,-1,,,,,,,,Article,10.1037/a0031963,,,,557,Clarivate Analytics Web of Science,,,,,,0021-843X,2,,,JOURNAL OF ABNORMAL PSYCHOLOGY,,,,DEFICIT-HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER|SELECTIVE AUDITORY ATTENTION|PRESCHOOL-CHILDREN|TASK-PERFORMANCE|PRIVATE SPEECH|MISSING DATA|SELF-CONTROL|IMPAIRMENT|ADHD|INTELLIGENCE,-1,"Petersen, Isaac/0000-0003-3072-6673",language and verbal ability|attentional problems|externalizing behavior problems|behavioral and self-regulation|child longitudinal,,MAY,J,2013,,,,,,"Psychology, Clinical|Psychiatry",,-1,,Psychology; Psychiatry,,55,Language Ability Predicts the Development of Behavior Problems in Children,58,,WOS:000319241100023,1,122,,23713507,C:\Users\mginda\Desktop\agc1\wos-extract.isi,"Petersen IT, 2013, V122, P542, DOI 10.1037/a0031963"

"Objective: Previous studies have found associations between childhood behavior problems and adolescent sexual risk behavior. Using a quasi-experimental approach, we examined the extent to which this association may be due to between-family differences (i.e., unmeasured familial confounds) not adequately explored in prior research. Methods: We used data from a longitudinal, population-based cohort of young twins in Sweden (first assessment: age 9 or 12 years; second assessment: age 15; n = 2,388). We explored the nature of the association between symptom scores for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), oppositional defiant disorder (ODD), and conduct disorder (CD) at age 9 or 12 and the likelihood of having had sexual intercourse and number of sexual partners by age 15. Two-level mixed-effects models were used to estimate the effect of symptom score on each outcome after controlling for potential unmeasured familial confounds. Results: Higher ADHD, ODD, and CD scores were associated with significantly increased likelihood of sexual intercourse by age 15. Higher ADHD and ODD scores were also associated with increased number of sexual partners. After controlling for unmeasured familial confounds, however, behavior problems were no longer significantly associated with either outcome. Conclusion: The association between childhood behavior problems and sexual risk behaviors may be due to characteristics shared within families. Hence, prevention strategies aimed at reducing these behaviors might need to address broader risk factors that contribute to both behavior problems and a greater likelihood of sexual risk behavior.

"Children with emotional and behavioral disturbance often have difficulties in multiple symptom domains. This study investigates the relationships between child symptoms and caregiver strain and parenting stress among 177 youth and their caregivers participating in a school-based system of care. Youth were grouped by symptom domain and included those with low scores on both internalizing and externalizing symptoms, those with only high internalizing symptoms, those with only high externalizing symptoms, and those with high symptoms levels in both internalizing and externalizing domains. Results revealed significant group differences on measures of caregiver strain and parenting stress. Caregivers of youth with symptoms in both internalizing and externalizing domains reported the highest levels of strain and stress; however, there was some variation in group differences by caregiver outcome. The results of this study emphasize the importance of providing not only services for youth but also support services for their caregivers.",,,"Bernard, SN|Brereton, M|Feinn, R|Kaufman, JS|Vaughan, EL","Bernard, Stanley N.|Brereton, Maria|Feinn, Richard|Kaufman, Joy S.|Vaughan, Ellen L.",534,-1,,,,,,,-1,,-1,,,,,,,,Article,10.1177/0192513X12440949,,,,556,Clarivate Analytics Web of Science,,,,,,0192-513X,4,,,JOURNAL OF FAMILY ISSUES,,,,MENTAL-HEALTH|HIGH-RISK|FAMILY|DISORDERS|SERVICE|ADHD|CARE|ADOLESCENCE|COMORBIDITY|SYSTEMS,-1,,caregiver strain|parenting stress|serious emotional and behavioral disturbance,,APR,J,2013,,,,,,Family Studies,,-1,,Family Studies,,26,Relationships Between Child Emotional and Behavioral Symptoms and Caregiver Strain and Parenting Stress,26,,WOS:000316914300005,1,34,,24707069,C:\Users\mginda\Desktop\agc1\wos-extract.isi,"Vaughan EL, 2013, V34, P534, DOI 10.1177/0192513X12440949"
"Urban children remain disproportionately at risk of having higher blood lead levels than their suburban counterparts. The Westside Cooperative Organization (WESCO), located in Marion County, Indianapolis, Indiana, has a history of children with high blood lead levels as well as high soil lead (Pb) values. This study aims at determining the spatial relationship between soil Pb sources and children's blood lead levels. Soils have been identified as a source of chronic Pb exposure to children, but the spatial scale of the source-recipient relationship is not well characterized. Neighborhood-wide analysis of soil Pb distribution along with a furnace filter technique for sampling interior Pb accumulation for selected homes (n = 7) in the WESCO community was performed. Blood lead levels for children aged 0-5 years during the period 1999-2008 were collected. The study population's mean blood lead levels were higher than national averages across all ages, race, and gender. Non-Hispanic blacks and those individuals in the Wishard advantage program had the highest proportion of elevated blood lead levels. The results show that while there is not a direct relationship between soil Pb and children's blood lead levels at a spatial scale of similar to 100 m, resuspension of locally sourced soil is occurring based on the interior Pb accumulation. County-wide, the largest predictor of elevated blood lead levels is the location within the urban core. Variation in soil Pb and blood lead levels on the community level is high and not predicted by housing stock age or income. Race is a strong predictor for blood lead levels in the WESCO community.",,"Wiehe, Sarah/R-6083-2017","Filippelli, G|Fuller, T|Lin, Q|Liu, GC|Morrison, D|Rosenman, MB|Wang, JN|Wiehe, SE","Filippelli, Gabriel|Fuller, Trevor|Lin, Qing|Liu, Gilbert C.|Morrison, Deborah|Rosenman, Marc B.|Wang, Jane|Wiehe, Sarah E.",171,-1,,,,,,,-1,,-1,,,,,,,,Article,10.1007/s10653-012-9474-y,,,,183,Clarivate Analytics Web of Science,,,,,,0269-4042,2,,,ENVIRONMENTAL GEOCHEMISTRY AND HEALTH,,,,EXPOSURE,-1,"Wiehe, Sarah/0000-0002-8148-0848",Lead|Soil|Health|Children|Environmental health,,APR,J,2013,,,,,,"Engineering, Environmental|Environmental Sciences|Public, Environmental & Occupational Health|Water Resources",,-1,,"Engineering; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Public, Environmental & Occupational Health; Water Resources",,12,Spatial relationships between lead sources and children's blood lead levels in the urban center of Indianapolis (USA),13,,WOS:000315596900002,1,35,,22782519,C:\Users\mginda\Desktop\agc1\wos-extract.isi,"Morrison D, 2013, V35, P171, DOI 10.1007/s10653-012-9474-y"
"Binge drinking during adolescence may perturb the maturing neuroenvironment and increase susceptibility of developing an alcohol use disorder later in life. In the present series of experiments, we utilized a modified version of the drinking in the dark-multiple scheduled access (DID-MSA) procedure to study how heavy binge drinking during adolescence alters responsivity to ethanol later in adulthood. Adult and adolescent C57BL/6J (B6) and DBA/2J (D2) males and females were given access to a 20% ethanol solution for 3 hourly periods, each separated by 2 h of free water access. B6 adults and adolescents consumed 2 to 3.5 g/kg ethanol an hour and displayed significant intoxication and binge-like blood ethanol concentrations. There was an interaction of sex and age, however, driven by high intakes in adult B6 females, who peaked at 11.01 g/kg. Adolescents of both sexes and adult males never consumed more than 9.3 g/kg. D2 mice consumed negligible amounts of alcohol and showed no evidence of intoxication. B6 mice were abstinent for one month and were retested on the balance beam 10 min following 1.75 g/kg ethanol challenge (20%v/v; i.p),They were also tested for changes in home cage locomotion immediately following the 1.75 g/kg dose (for 10 min prior to balance beam). Although there was no effect of age of exposure, all mice with a binge drinking history demonstrated a significantly dampened ataxic response to an ethanol challenge. Female mice that binge drank during adulthood showed a significantly augmented locomotor response to ethanol when compared to their water drinking controls. This alteration was not noted for males or for females that binge drank during adolescence. These results highlight the importance of biological sex, and its interaction with age, in the development of behavioral adaptation following binge drinking.

"Background. Little is known about suicide risk among offspring of parents hospitalized for schizophrenia and the mechanisms behind this association. Method. We applied a nested case-control design based on linkage of Swedish population-based registers. Among 12- to 30-year-old offspring, we identified 68 318 offspring with suicidal behavior (attempted and completed suicide) and their parents. Five healthy control-parent pairs were matched to each suicidal case-parent pair and conditional logistic regression used to obtain odds ratios (ORs). Further, to disentangle familial confounding from causal environmental mechanisms, we compared the population-based suicide risk with the risk found within full-cousins and half-cousins differentially exposed to parental schizophrenia. Results. Offspring of parents with schizophrenia had significantly increased suicide risk after accounting for socio-economic status, parental suicidal behavior and offspring mental illness [OR 1.68, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.53-1.85]. Suicide risks in offspring of schizophrenic mothers and fathers were similar in magnitude; so were risks across different developmental periods. Importantly, offspring suicide risk remained essentially unchanged across genetically different relationships; offspring of siblings discordant for schizophrenia had equivalent risk increases within full-cousins (OR 1.96, 95% CI 1.66-2.31) and half-cousins (OR 1.69, 95% CI 1.17-2.44). Conclusions. Parental schizophrenia was associated with increased risk of offspring suicidal behavior, independent of gender of the schizophrenic parent, and persisting into adulthood. The suicide risk in offspring remained at a similar level when comparing genetically different relationships, which suggests that at least part of the association is due to environmental mechanisms. These findings should inspire increased attention to suicidal ideation and prevention efforts in offspring of parents with schizophrenia.",,"Sandin, Sven/L-5357-2015","D'Onofrio, BM|Langstorm, N|Larsson, H|Lichtenstein, P|Ljung, T|Runeson, B|Sandin, S","D'Onofrio, Brian M.|Langstorm, Niklas|Larsson, Henrik|Lichtenstein, Paul|Ljung, Therese|Runeson, Bo|Sandin, Sven",581,-1,,,,,,,-1,,-1,,,,,,,,Article,10.1017/S0033291712001365,,,,590,Clarivate Analytics Web of Science,,,,,,0033-2917,3,,,PSYCHOLOGICAL MEDICINE,,,,UNNATURAL CAUSES|EARLY ADULTHOOD|PSYCHIATRIC-INPATIENTS|LONGITUDINAL REGISTERS|COMPLETED SUICIDE|FAMILIAL FACTORS|MENTAL-ILLNESS|FOLLOW-UP|BEHAVIOR|DISORDERS,-1,"Sandin, Sven/0000-0001-6994-4884; lichtenstein, paul/0000-0003-3037-5287; Runeson, Bo/0000-0003-4122-4636; Larsson, Henrik/0000-0002-6851-3297",Environmental risk|familial confounding|nationwide registers|parental schizophrenia|suicidal behaviour,,MAR,J,2013,,,,,,"Psychology, Clinical|Psychiatry|Psychology",,-1,,Psychology; Psychiatry,,5,Parental schizophrenia and increased offspring suicide risk: exploring the causal hypothesis using cousin comparisons,5,,WOS:000314294600011,1,43,,22703756,C:\Users\mginda\Desktop\agc1\wos-extract.isi,"Ljung T, 2013, V43, P581, DOI 10.1017/S0033291712001365"

"Teenage childbirth is a risk factor for poor offspring outcomes, particularly offspring antisocial behavior. It is not clear, however, if maternal age at first birth (MAFB) is causally associated with offspring antisocial behavior or if this association is due to selection factors that influence both the likelihood that a young woman gives birth early and that her offspring engage in antisocial behavior. The current study addresses the limitations of previous research by using longitudinal data from Swedish national registries and children of siblings and children of twins comparisons to identify the extent to which the association between MAFB and offspring criminal convictions is consistent with a causal influence and confounded by genetic or environmental factors that make cousins similar. We found offspring born to mothers who began childbearing earlier were more likely to be convicted of a crime than offspring born to mothers who delayed childbearing. The results from comparisons of differentially exposed cousins, especially born to discordant monozygotic twin sisters, provide support for a causal association between MAFB and offspring criminal convictions. The analyses also found little evidence for genetic confounding due to passive gene-environment correlation.

"Objective: Previous studies have found an association between early age at first sexual intercourse and subsequent psychosocial maladjustment. Using a quasi-experimental approach, we examined the extent to which this observed association may be due to familial confounds not explored in prior research. Methods: Using a population-based cohort of Swedish adult twins (ages 19-47; N = 12,126), we examined the nature of the association between early sexual intercourse (i.e., first intercourse occurring before age 16) and various outcomes reflecting psychosocial health, including substance use, depression, criminal convictions, and adolescent childbearing. We used two methods-discordant-twin analyses and bivariate twin modeling-to estimate the extent to which genetic and environmental confounds explained observed associations. Results: Individuals who engaged in early intercourse were at greater risk for most of the adverse psychosocial health outcomes measured in this study. However, twin pairs discordant for engaging in early intercourse did not differ significantly in their risk for psychosocial maladjustment. Our results indicated that early age at first sexual intercourse and subsequent psychosocial maladjustment may be associated because of familial factors shared by twins. Conclusions: Early intercourse may be associated with poor psychosocial health largely due to shared familial influences rather than through a direct causal connection. Therefore, effective and efficient interventions should address other risk factors common to early intercourse and poor psychosocial health.",,,"Donahue, KL|D'Onofrio, BM|Langstorm, N|Lichtenstein, P","Donahue, Kelly L.|D'Onofrio, Brian M.|Langstorm, Niklas|Lichtenstein, Paul",180,-1,,,,,,,-1,,-1,,,,,,,,Article,10.1037/a0028922,,,,189,Clarivate Analytics Web of Science,,,,,,0278-6133,2,,,HEALTH PSYCHOLOGY,,,,POPULATION-BASED TWIN|DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS|RISK BEHAVIOR|ENVIRONMENTAL-INFLUENCES|CAUSAL INFERENCE|VIOLENT CRIME|FEMALE TWINS|1ST SEX|AGE|ADOLESCENTS,-1,"lichtenstein, paul/0000-0003-3037-5287",adolescence|sexual behavior|sex-education programs|behavior genetics,,FEB,J,2013,,,,,,"Psychology, Clinical|Psychology",,-1,,Psychology,,12,Why Does Early Sexual Intercourse Predict Subsequent Maladjustment?

"Adolescent individuals display altered behavioral sensitivity to ethanol, which may contribute to the increased ethanol consumption seen in this age-group. However, genetics also exert considerable influence on both ethanol intake and sensitivity. Currently there is little research assessing the combined influence of developmental and genetic alcohol sensitivities. Sensitivity to the aversive effects of ethanol using a conditioned taste aversion (CTA) procedure was measured during both adolescence (P30) and adulthood (P75) in eight inbred mouse strains (C57BL/6J, DBA/2J, 129S1/SvImJ, A/J, BALB/cByJ, BTBR T+tf/J, C3H/HeJ and FVB/NJ). Adolescent and adult mice were water deprived, and subsequently provided with access to 0.9% (v/v) NaCl solution for 1?h. Immediately following access mice were administered ethanol (0, 1.5, 2.25 and 3?g/kg, ip). This procedure was repeated in 72?h intervals for a total of five CTA trials. Sensitivity to the aversive effects of ethanol was highly dependent upon both strain and age. Within an inbred strain, adolescent animals were consistently less sensitive to the aversive effects of ethanol than their adult counterparts. However, the dose of ethanol required to produce an aversion response differed as a function of both age and strain.",,,"Boehm, SL|Forrest, RD|Moore, EM","Boehm, Stephen L., II|Forrest, R.

"Propensity to develop acute functional (or within session) tolerance to alcohol (ethanol) may influence the amount of alcohol consumed, with higher drinking associated with greater acute functional tolerance (AFT). The goal of this study was to assess this potential correlated response between alcohol preference and AFT in second and third replicate lines of mice selectively bred for high (HAP2 and HAP3) and low (LAP2 and LAP3) alcohol preference drinking. Male and female mice were tested for development of AFT on a static dowel task, which requires that animals maintain balance on a wooden dowel in order to prevent falling. On test day, each mouse received one (1.75?g/kg; Experiment 1) or two (1.75?and 2.0?g/kg; Experiment 2) injections of ethanol; an initial administration before being placed on the dowel and in Experiment 2, an additional administration after the first regain of balance on the dowel. Blood samples were taken immediately after loss of balance [when blood ethanol concentrations (BECs) were rising] and at recovery (during falling BECs) in Experiment 1, and after first and second recovery in Experiment 2. It was found that HAP mice fell from the dowel significantly earlier and at lower BECs than LAP mice following the initial injection of ethanol and were therefore more sensitive to its early effects. Furthermore, Experiment 1 detected significantly greater AFT development (BECfalling - BECrising) in HAP mice when compared with LAP mice, which occurred within 30?min, supporting our hypothesis. However, AFT was not different between lines in Experiment 2, indicating that 3060?min following alcohol administration, AFT development was similar in both lines. These data show that high alcohol drinking genetically associates with both high initial sensitivity and very early tolerance to the ataxic effects of ethanol.",,,"Boehm, SL|Fritz, BM|Grahame, NJ","Boehm, Stephen L., II|Fritz, Brandon M.|Grahame, Nicholas J.",78,-1,,,,,,,-1,,-1,,,,,,,,Article,10.1111/j.1601-183X.2012.00830.x,,,,86,Clarivate Analytics Web of Science,,,,,,1601-1848,1,,,GENES BRAIN AND BEHAVIOR,,,,INITIAL SENSITIVITY|SOCIAL DRINKERS|INBRED MICE|ETHANOL|INTOXICATION|LINES|RISK|IMPAIRMENT|ADDICTION|HEAVY,-1,,Addiction|alcohol|ataxia|behavior|ethanol|genetics|mouse|selected lines|sensitivity|tolerance,,FEB,J,2013,,,,,,Behavioral Sciences|Neurosciences,,-1,,Behavioral Sciences; Neurosciences & Neurology,,8,Selection for high alcohol preference drinking in mice results in heightened sensitivity and rapid development of acute functional tolerance to alcohol's ataxic effects,8,,WOS:000313994500009,1,12,,22853703,C:\Users\mginda\Desktop\agc1\wos-extract.isi,"Fritz BM, 2013, V12, P78, DOI 10.1111/j.1601-183X.2012.00830.x"
"Previous studies of the association between multiple parental relationship transitions (i.e., when a parent begins or terminates an intimate relationship involving cohabitation) and offspring antisocial behavior have varied in their efforts to rule out confounding influences, such as parental antisocial behavior and low income. They also have been limited in the representativeness of their samples. Thus, it remains unclear to what degree parents' multiple relationship transitions have independent effects on children's antisocial behavior. Analyses were conducted using data on 8,652 6-9-year-old, 6,911 10-13-year-old, and 6,495 14-17-year-old offspring of a nationally representative sample of U.S. women. Cousin-comparisons were used in combination with statistical covariates to evaluate the associations between maternal relationship transitions and offspring antisocial behavior in childhood and adolescence. Cousin-comparisons suggested that associations between maternal relationship transitions and antisocial behavior in childhood and early adolescence are largely explained by confounding factors. In contrast, the associations between maternal relationship transitions and offspring delinquency in late adolescence were robust to measured and unmeasured confounds. The present findings suggest that interventions aimed at reducing exposure to parental relationship transitions or addressing the psychosocial consequences of exposure to parental relationship transitions could reduce risk for offspring delinquency in late adolescence.",,,"Cherlin, AJ|D'Onofrio, BM|Emery, RE|Goodnight, JA|Lahey, BB|Van Hulle, CA","Cherlin, Andrew J.|D'Onofrio, Brian M.|Emery, Robert E.|Goodnight, Jackson A.|Lahey, Benjamin B.|Van Hulle, Carol A.",185,-1,,,,,,,-1,,-1,,,,,,,,Article,10.1007/s10802-012-9667-y,,,,198,Clarivate Analytics Web of Science,,,,,,0091-0627,2,,,JOURNAL OF ABNORMAL CHILD PSYCHOLOGY,,,,PARENTAL DIVORCE|UNITED-STATES|FAMILY INSTABILITY|DELINQUENT-BEHAVIOR|MARITAL DISRUPTION|CONDUCT PROBLEMS|BOYS ADJUSTMENT|CHILDREN|PSYCHOPATHOLOGY|COHABITATION,-1,,Antisocial behavior|Family instability|Relationship transitions|Cousin-comparisons,,FEB,J,2013,,,,,,"Psychology, Clinical|Psychology, Developmental",,-1,,Psychology,,8,Effects of Multiple Maternal Relationship Transitions on Offspring Antisocial Behavior in Childhood and Adolescence: A Cousin-Comparison Analysis,8,,WOS:000314093200001,1,41,,22829173,C:\Users\mginda\Desktop\agc1\wos-extract.isi,"Goodnight JA, 2013, V41, P185, DOI 10.1007/s10802-012-9667-y"
"Current research offers a limited understanding of parental experiences when reporting bullying to school officials. This research examines the experiences of middle-school parents as they took steps to protect their bullied youth. The qualitative tradition of interpretive phenomenology was used to provide in-depth analysis of the phenomena. A criterion-based, purposeful sample of 11 parents was interviewed face-to-face with subsequent phone call follow-ups. Interviews were taped, transcribed, and coded. MAX qda software was used for data coding. In analyzing the interviews, paradigm cases, themes, and patterns were identified. Three parent stages were found: discovering, reporting, and living with the aftermath. In the discovery stage, parents reported using advice-giving in hopes of protecting their youth. As parents noticed negative psychosocial symptoms in their youth escalate, they shifted their focus to reporting the bullying to school officials. All but one parent experienced ongoing resistance from school officials in fully engaging the bullying problem. In the aftermath, 10 of the 11 parents were left with two choices: remove their youth from the school or let the victimization continue. One paradigm case illustrates how a school official met parental expectations of protection. This study highlights a parental sense of ambiguity of school officials' roles and procedures related to school reporting and intervention. The results of this study have implications in the development and use of school-wide bullying protocols and parental advocacy.",,,"Aalsma, MC|Brown, JR|Ott, MA","Aalsma, Matthew C.|Brown, James R.|Ott, Mary A.",494,-1,,,,,,,-1,,-1,,,,,,,,Article,10.1177/0886260512455513,,,,518,Clarivate Analytics Web of Science,,,,,,0886-2605,3,,,JOURNAL OF INTERPERSONAL VIOLENCE,,,,PEER VICTIMIZATION|ADJUSTMENT|KINDERGARTEN|PERCEPTIONS|ASSOCIATION|RESPONSES|CHILDREN,-1,,bullying|parent|trauma|school response|middle-school victimization|anti-bullying policy|interpersonal violence|qualitative,,FEB,J,2013,,,,,,"Criminology & Penology|Family Studies|Psychology, Applied",,-1,,Criminology & Penology; Family Studies; Psychology,,7,The Experiences of Parents Who Report Youth Bullying Victimization to School Officials,7,,WOS:000312731600003,1,28,,22929346,C:\Users\mginda\Desktop\agc1\wos-extract.isi,"Brown JR, 2013, V28, P494, DOI 10.1177/0886260512455513"

"The factor mixture model (FMM) uses a hybrid of both categorical and continuous latent variables. The FMM is a good model for the underlying structure of psychopathology because the use of both categorical and continuous latent variables allows the structure to be simultaneously categorical and dimensional. This is useful because both diagnostic class membership and the range of severity within and across diagnostic classes can be modeled concurrently. Although the conceptualization of the FMM has been explained in the literature, the use of the FMM is still not prevalent. One reason is that there is little research about how such models should be applied in practice and, once a well-fitting model is obtained, how it should be interpreted. In this article, the FMM is explored by studying a real data example on conduct disorder. By exploring this example, this article aims to explain the different formulations of the FMM, the various steps in building a FMM, and how to decide between an FMM and alternative models.",,,"Clark, SL|D'Onofrio, BM|Kaprio, J|Muthen, B|Rose, RJ|Viken, R","Clark, Shaunna L.|D'Onofrio, Brian M.|Kaprio, Jaakko|Muthen, Bengt|Rose, Richard J.|Viken, Richard",681,-1,,,,,,,-1,,-1,,,,,,,,Article,10.1080/10705511.2013.824786,,,,703,Clarivate Analytics Web of Science,,,,,,1070-5511,4,,,STRUCTURAL EQUATION MODELING-A MULTIDISCIPLINARY JOURNAL,,,,CONFIRMATORY FACTOR-ANALYSIS|LATENT TRAJECTORY CLASSES|ALCOHOL DEPENDENCE|OVEREXTRACTION|NUMBER,-1,,factor mixture model|finite mixture model|latent class analysis,,,J,2013,,,,,,"Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications|Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",,-1,,Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,,38,Models and Strategies for Factor Mixture Analysis: An Example Concerning the Structure Underlying Psychological Disorders,39,,WOS:000330347100007,1,20,1532-8007,24302849,C:\Users\mginda\Desktop\agc1\wos-extract.isi,"Clark SL, 2013, V20, P681, DOI 10.1080/10705511.2013.824786"

"Adverse childhood experiences and substance use have been identified as potential causal risk factors for early-onset sexual intercourse. While it is possible that exposure to these risk factors directly increases the likelihood of engaging in early intercourse, an alternative explanation is that observed associations between these variables are due to shared familial confounds. These unmeasured confounds may increase the likelihood of being exposed to these risk factors and of engaging in early intercourse. Participants drawn from a population-based study of Swedish adult twins (ages 19-47 years; N = 12,126) reported on their history of exposure to early physical and sexual trauma, cigarette use, and cannabis use. We investigated the nature of the association between these risk factors and young age at first intercourse, using a comparison of twins differentially exposed to each risk factor. When compared to non-exposed, unrelated individuals, participants who reported adverse childhood experiences or who engaged in early cigarette use or cannabis use were more likely to engage in early intercourse. However, co-twin comparisons indicated that observed associations between these risk factors and early intercourse may be due to familial factors shared within twin pairs, and risk factor exposure may not lead directly to early intercourse. Our results suggest that preventing trauma exposure or preventing or delaying adolescents' cigarette smoking or cannabis use may not effectively delay intercourse onset; instead, other aspects of the adolescent's environment should be addressed.",,,"Donahue, KL|D'Onofrio, BM|Langstorm, N|Lichtenstein, P","Donahue, Kelly L.|D'Onofrio, Brian M.|Langstorm, Niklas|Lichtenstein, Paul",35,-1,,,,,,,-1,,-1,,,,,,,,Article,10.1007/s10508-012-9947-1,,,,44,Clarivate Analytics Web of Science,,,,,,0004-0002,1,,,ARCHIVES OF SEXUAL BEHAVIOR,,,,1ST SEXUAL INTERCOURSE|ADOLESCENT SUBSTANCE USE|USE DISORDERS|BEHAVIOR|CHILDHOOD|AGE|INITIATION|ABUSE|WOMEN|ALCOHOL,-1,"lichtenstein, paul/0000-0003-3037-5287",Adolescence|Sexual behavior|Substance use|Child abuse|Co-twin comparison|Behavioral genetics,,JAN,J,2013,,,,,,"Psychology, Clinical|Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",,-1,,Psychology; Social Sciences - Other Topics,,8,Testing Putative Causal Associations of Risk Factors for Early Intercourse in the Study of Twin Adults: Genes and Environment (STAGE),8,,WOS:000312632400005,1,42,1573-2800,22441771,C:\Users\mginda\Desktop\agc1\wos-extract.isi,"Donahue KL, 2013, V42, P35, DOI 10.1007/s10508-012-9947-1"
"Background: In malignant melanoma, it has been published that up to 40% of cancer patients will suffer from brain metastasis. The prognosis for these patients is poor, with a life expectancy of 4 to 6 months. Calcium exchange is involved in numerous cell functions. Recently, three types of cellular calcium sequestration have been reported in the medical literature. The first describes a transgenic mouse model in which an increase of aberrant calcium channels triggers hypertrophy and apoptosis. The second provides a protective mechanism whereby astrocytes in the brain inhibit apoptosis of tumor cells by moving ionic calcium out of the tumor cells thru gap junctions. The third is via calcium chelation, which causes cell apoptosis by converting ionic calcium into a calcium salt. This process has been shown to operate in atrial myocardial cells, thus not allowing the intracellular calcium stores to flow through the myocytes intercalated discs. Ideally chemotherapeutic agents would be those that initiate apoptosis in tumor cells. Presentation of the Hypothesis: We hypothesize that the recent reported intracellular calcium sequestration by oxalate chelation, due to its chemical process of converting ionic calcium into a calcium salt, may inhibit the protective effect of astrocytes on brain tumor metastasized melanoma cells by not allowing free calcium to leave the metastatic cells, simultaneously apoptosis of tumor and some healthy adjacent cells could occur. This hypothesis could be extended to include other cancerous tumors such as skin cancers amongst others. Testing the hypothesis: Using the experimental model showing the protective mechanism of co-cultured reactive astrocytes and tumor cells treated with oxalates could be used to test this hypothesis in vitro. The calcium specific von Kossa technique could be used to confirm the presence of chelated intracellular calcium architecture of the metastatic cells (which is a sign of apoptosis), and extracellular calcium chelation stores of the Astrocytes (which has been shown to slow neural conduction). Implications of the Hypothesis: The life expectancy in patients with metastasized malignant melanoma brain tumors could be significantly prolonged if the chemotherapeutic issue of brain metastasis is overcome. Other cancerous tumors can also be treated by this Targeted Chelation Approach. Ionic calcium sequestration using naturally occurring calcium chelators, viz., oxalates, could accomplish this desired outcome.",,"Embi, Peter/E-3030-2011","Embi, A|Embi, PJ|Menes, M|Po, SS|Scherlag, BJ","Embi, Abraham|Embi, Peter J.|Menes, Manuel|Po, Sunny S.|Scherlag, Benjamin J.",,-1,,,,,,,-1,,-1,,,,,,,,Article,10.1186/1475-2867-12-51,,,,,Clarivate Analytics Web of Science,,,,,,1475-2867,,,,CANCER CELL INTERNATIONAL,,,51,BRAIN METASTASES|MELANOMA,-1,,Oxalates|Calcium chelation|Calcium sequestration|Apoptosis|Cancer cells|Metastatic melanoma|Astrocytes|Blood-brain barrier,,8-Dec,J,2012,,,,,,Oncology,,-1,,Oncology,,1,Targeted cellular ionic calcium chelation by oxalates: Implications for the treatment of tumor cells,1,,WOS:000313943800001,1,12,,23216811,C:\Users\mginda\Desktop\agc1\wos-extract.isi,"Embi A, 2012, V12, DOI 10.1186/1475-2867-12-51"
"Background: Previous studies have found that child attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is associated with more parental marital problems. However, the reasons for this association are unclear. The association might be due to genetic or environmental confounds that contribute to both marital problems and ADHD. Method: Data were drawn from the Australian Twin Registry, including 1,296 individual twins, their spouses, and offspring. We studied adult twins who were discordant for offspring ADHD. Using a discordant twin pairs design, we examined the extent to which genetic and environmental confounds, as well as measured parental and offspring characteristics, explain the ADHD-marital problems association. Results: Offspring ADHD predicted parental divorce and marital conflict. The associations were also robust when comparing differentially exposed identical twins to control for unmeasured genetic and environmental factors, when controlling for measured maternal and paternal psychopathology, when restricting the sample based on timing of parental divorce and ADHD onset, and when controlling for other forms of offspring psychopathology. Each of these controls rules out alternative explanations for the association. Conclusion: The results of the current study converge with those of prior research in suggesting that factors directly associated with offspring ADHD increase parental marital problems.",,,"D'Onofrio, BM|Emery, RE|Harden, KP|Heath, AC|Martin, NG|Schermerhorn, AC|Slutske, WS|Turkheimer, E","D'Onofrio, Brian M.|Emery, Robert E.|Harden, K.

"Context: Previous epidemiological, animal, and human cognitive neuroscience research suggests that maternal smoking during pregnancy (SDP) causes increased risk of substance use/problems in offspring. Objective: To determine the extent to which the association between SDP and offspring substance use/problems depends on confounded familial background factors by using a quasi-experimental design. Design: We used 2 separate samples from the United States and Sweden. The analyses prospectively predicted multiple indices of substance use and problems while controlling for statistical covariates and comparing differentially exposed siblings to minimize confounding. Setting: Offspring of a representative sample of women in the United States (sample 1) and the total Swedish population born during the period from January 1, 1983, to December 31, 1995 (sample 2). Patients or Other Participants: Adolescent offspring of the women in the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979 (n=6904) and all offspring born in Sweden during the 13-year period (n=1187360). Main Outcome Measures: Self-reported adolescent alcohol, cigarette, and marijuana use and early onset (before 14 years of age) of each substance (sample 1) and substance-related convictions and hospitalizations for an alcohol-or other drug-related problem (sample 2). Results: The same pattern emerged for each index of substance use/problems across the 2 samples. At the population level, maternal SDP predicted every measure of offspring substance use/problems in both samples, ranging from adolescent alcohol use (hazard ratio [HR](moderate), 1.32 [95% CI, 1.22-1.43]; HRhigh, 1.33 [1.17-1.53]) to a narcotics-related conviction (HRmoderate, 2.23 [2.14-2.31]; HRhigh, 2.97 [2.86-3.09]). When comparing differentially exposed siblings to minimize genetic and environmental confounds, however, the association between SDP and each measure of substance use/problems was minimal and not statistically significant. Conclusions: The association between maternal SDP and offspring substance use/problems is likely due to familial background factors, not a causal influence, because siblings have similar rates of substance use and problems regardless of their specific exposure to SDP.

"Objective: To evaluate Positive Choices (PC), a program that employed lay health workers to motivate antiretroviral adherence among persons living with HIV with coverage from Indiana's high-risk insurance pool. Methods: Four hundred and forty nine participants living in the greater Indianapolis area were randomly allocated to treatment (n = 91) or control (n = 358) groups and followed for one year. Results: Compared to control subjects, PC subjects were more likely to adhere to HIV medications (medication possession ratio adherence >= 0.95, OR = 1.83, p = 0.046), and to achieve undetectable viral load (<50 copies/mL, OR = 2.01, p = 0.011) in the 12 months following introduction of PC. There were no significant differences observed between groups in any of self-reported health status indicators. Conclusion: Estimates suggest that PC clients were 16% more likely to have undetectable viral loads than clients in standard care. The incremental program cost was approximately $10,000 for each additional person who achieved an undetectable viral load. Practice implications: As persons living with HIV experience greater longevity and healthcare reform expands coverage to these high-risk populations, greater demands will be placed on the HIV-care workforce. Results suggest lay health workers may serve as effective adjuncts to professional care providers. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

"Identifying practices of masculinity socialization that contribute to the establishment of gender privilege can help address violence and bullying in schools (Connell, 1996). Because the sport of football is considered an important contributor to masculinity construction, establishing peer networks, and creating hierarchies of student status, this study examined the influence of social norms (i.e., moral atmosphere, meanings of adolescent masculinity) on bullying beliefs and behaviors of 206 high school football players. Results demonstrated that moral atmosphere (Peer Influence, Influential Male Figure) and adherence to male role norms significantly predicted bullying, but the strongest predictor was the perception of whether the most influential male in a player's life would approve of the bullying behavior. In addition to prevention interventions highlighting the role of influential men and masculinity norms in this process, implications for practice suggest that football players can use their peer influence and status as center sport participants to create a school culture that does not tolerate bullying.",,,"LaFollette, JR|Steinfeldt, JA|Steinfeldt, MC|Vaughan, EL","LaFollette, Julie R.|Steinfeldt, Jesse A.|Steinfeldt, Matthew C.|Vaughan, Ellen L.",340,-1,,,,,,,-1,,-1,,,,,,,,Article,10.1037/a0026645,,,,353,Clarivate Analytics Web of Science,,,,,,1524-9220,4,,,PSYCHOLOGY OF MEN & MASCULINITY,,,,MIDDLE SCHOOL STUDENTS|SOCIAL IDENTITY|COLLEGE MEN|AGGRESSION|ATTITUDES|SPORTS|GENDER|NORMS|PREDICTORS|BEHAVIORS,-1,,meanings of adolescent masculinity|gender role norms|high school student-athletes|moral functioning|aggression|American football,,OCT,J,2012,,,,,,"Psychology, Social",,-1,,Psychology,,18,Bullying Among Adolescent Football Players: Role of Masculinity and Moral Atmosphere,18,,WOS:000310040500002,1,13,1939-151X,,C:\Users\mginda\Desktop\agc1\wos-extract.isi,"Steinfeldt JA, 2012, V13, P340, DOI 10.1037/a0026645"
"Objective: This study assessed rates of mental health care utilization among juvenile detainees upon community reentry and examined the impact of a mental health screening and referral program. Methods: A pre-post cohort design was used: 24 months before and after implementation of the program. The sample included 7,265 observations from 6,345 participants age 13 to 18 (first cohort, 4,812; second, 2,453). Outcomes included mental health care utilization (30 and 60 days postdetention) and recidivism (three and six months postdetention). Results: Logistic regression models of utilization at 30 days, controlling for cohort differences with propensity scores, found that males were less likely than females to have a mental health visit (odds ratio [011]=.54, 95% confidence interval [CI]=.45.64, p<.01); the likelihood was also lower among black (011=.52, CI=.44.62, p<.01) and Hispanic (OR=.12, CI=.07.22, p<.01) youths, compared with white youths, and among older youths (OR=.53, CI=.50.57, p<.01) (similar results at 60 days). No overall significant differences between cohorts were found in visits at 30 (first cohort, 14%; second, 16%) and 60 (17To and 19%, respectively) days postrelease. An age interaction with cohort indicated a cohort difference among adolescents in the middle tertile (14.6-16.5 years) in utilization at 30 (first cohort, 12%; second, 17%) and 60 (16% and 21%) days. Compared with the preimplementation cohort, the postimplementation cohort had higher recidivism rates at three (first cohort, 24%; second, 31%) and six (36% and 43%) months. Conclusions: Connection to services upon community reentry, was poor among detained youths. A screening and referral program was not sufficient to increase utilization rates.

"Previous research has shown negative affect and emotion dysregulation to be significant predictors of adverse outcomes. Because justice-involved adolescents have demonstrated more negative emotionality and fewer adaptive emotion regulation strategies than their non-justice-involved peers, they may be particularly susceptible to maladaptive behavior. The current study investigated the extent to which negative affect and facets of emotion dysregulation were associated with violence and risky sexual behavior. Participants included 94 justice-involved adolescents who were recruited while waiting for their court date and asked to complete several questionnaires. Results suggest that global negative affect and emotion dysregulation are not associated with violence or risky sexual behavior. However, specific aspects of negative affect (anger) and emotion dysregulation (impulse control difficulties) did predict violence. Examination of conditional effects also suggested that negative affect is significantly associated with violence and risky sexual behavior in adolescents who have specific difficulties regulating their emotions (e.g., poor emotional clarity and limited access to emotion regulation strategies). This study demonstrates the utility of examining negative affect and emotion regulation as heterogeneous constructs that interact in specific ways to predict violence.",,,"Aalsma, MC|Miller, DJ|Vachon, DD","Aalsma, Matthew C.|Miller, Drew J.|Vachon, David D.",1316,-1,,,,,,,-1,,-1,,,,,,,,Article,10.1177/0093854812448784,,,,1327,Clarivate Analytics Web of Science,,,,,,0093-8548,10,,,CRIMINAL JUSTICE AND BEHAVIOR,,,,ALCOHOL-USE|HIV RISK|MOOD|PERSONALITY|MODEL|DELINQUENCY|AGGRESSION|VALIDATION|PREDICTORS|DISORDER,-1,,negative affect|emotion dysregulation|violence|sexual behavior,,OCT,J,2012,,,,,,"Psychology, Clinical|Criminology & Penology",,-1,,Psychology; Criminology & Penology,,6,NEGATIVE AFFECT AND EMOTION DYSREGULATION Conditional Relations With Violence and Risky Sexual Behavior in a Sample of Justice-Involved Adolescents,6,,WOS:000309076900003,1,39,,,C:\Users\mginda\Desktop\agc1\wos-extract.isi,"Miller DJ, 2012, V39, P1316, DOI 10.1177/0093854812448784"
"The primary goal was to describe the health care coverage of detained youth. An exploratory second goal was to describe the possible relationship between redetention and coverage. Health care coverage status was abstracted from electronic detention center records for 1,614 adolescents in an urban detention center (October 2006 to December 2007). The majority of detained youth reported having Medicaid coverage (66%); 18% had private insurance and 17% had no insurance. Lack of insurance was more prevalent among older, male, and Hispanic youth. A substantial minority of detained youth were uninsured or had inconsistent coverage over time.

"A genetically-informed, quasi-experimental design was used to examine the genetic and environmental processes underlying associations between current parental depressive symptoms and offspring perceived self-competence. Participants, drawn from a population-based Swedish sample, were 852 twin pairs and their male (52 %) and female offspring aged 15.7 +/- A 2.4 years. Parental depressive symptoms were measured using the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression scale. Offspring perceived self-competence was measured using a modified Harter Perceived Competence Scale. Cousin comparisons and Children of Twins designs suggested that associations between maternal depressive symptoms and offspring perceived self-competence were due to shared genetic/environmental liability. The mechanism responsible for father-offspring associations, however, was independent of genetic factors and of extended family environmental factors, supporting a causal inference. Thus, mothers and fathers may impact offspring perceived self-competence via different mechanisms and unmeasured genetic and environmental selection factors must be considered when studying the intergenerational transmission of cognitive vulnerabilities for depression.",,,"Class, QA|D'Onofrio, BM|Ganiban, JM|Lichtenstein, P|Neiderhiser, JM|Reiss, D|Singh, AL|Spotts, EL","Class, Quetzal A.|D'Onofrio, Brian M.|Ganiban, Jody M.|Lichtenstein, Paul|Neiderhiser, Jenae M.|Reiss, David|Singh, Amber L.|Spotts, Erica L.",787,-1,,,,,,,-1,,-1,,,,,,,,Article,10.1007/s10519-012-9550-1,,,,797,Clarivate Analytics Web of Science,,,,,,0001-8244,5,,,BEHAVIOR GENETICS,,,,INTERGENERATIONAL TRANSMISSION|ADOLESCENT DEPRESSION|MATERNAL DEPRESSION|GENETIC PERSPECTIVE|EXTENDED CHILDREN|SYMPTOMS|BEHAVIOR|TWINS|PSYCHOPATHOLOGY|ESTEEM,-1,"lichtenstein, paul/0000-0003-3037-5287",Perceived self-competence|Perceived competence|Parental depression|Quasi-experimental design|Children of Twins|Cousin comparison,,SEP,J,2012,,,,,,"Behavioral Sciences|Genetics & Heredity|Psychology, Multidisciplinary",,-1,,Behavioral Sciences; Genetics & Heredity; Psychology,,6,Current Parental Depression and Offspring Perceived Self-Competence: A Quasi-Experimental Examination,6,,WOS:000308816400008,1,42,,22692226,C:\Users\mginda\Desktop\agc1\wos-extract.isi,"Class QA, 2012, V42, P787, DOI 10.1007/s10519-012-9550-1"
"Children born to older fathers are at higher risk to develop severe psychopathology (e.g., schizophrenia and bipolar disorder), possibly because of increased de novo mutations during spermatogenesis with older paternal age. Because severe psychopathology is correlated with antisocial behavior, we examined possible associations between advancing paternal age and offspring violent offending. Interlinked Swedish national registers provided information on fathers' age at childbirth and violent criminal convictions in all offspring born from 1958 to 1979 (N = 2,359,921). We used ever committing a violent crime and number of violent crimes as indices of violent offending. The data included information on multiple levels; we compared differentially exposed siblings in within-family analyses to rigorously test causal influences. In the entire population, advancing paternal age predicted offspring violent crime according to both indices. Congruent with a causal effect, this association remained for rates of violent crime in within-family analyses. However, in within-family analyses, we found no association with ever committing a violent crime, suggesting that factors shared by siblings (genes and environment) confounded this association. Life-course persistent criminality has been proposed to have a partly biological etiology; our results agree with a stronger biological effect (i.e., de novo mutations) on persistent violent offending.",,,"D'Onofrio, BM|Kuja-Halkola, R|Langstorm, N|Lichtenstein, P|Pawitan, Y","D'Onofrio, Brian M.|Kuja-Halkola, Ralf|Langstorm, Niklas|Lichtenstein, Paul|Pawitan, Yudi",739,-1,,,,,,,-1,,-1,,,,,,,,Article,10.1017/S095457941200034X,,,,753,Clarivate Analytics Web of Science,,,,,,0954-5794,3,,,DEVELOPMENT AND PSYCHOPATHOLOGY,,,,ANTISOCIAL-BEHAVIOR|BIPOLAR DISORDER|RISK-FACTORS|MATERNAL AGE|COUNT DATA|SCHIZOPHRENIA|CRIME|AUTISM|BIRTH|INTELLIGENCE,-1,"lichtenstein, paul/0000-0003-3037-5287; Kuja-Halkola, Ralf/0000-0002-3765-2067",,,AUG,J,2012,,,,,,"Psychology, Developmental",,-1,SI,Psychology,,6,Advancing paternal age and offspring violent offending: A sibling-comparison study,6,,WOS:000306680100004,1,24,,22781852,C:\Users\mginda\Desktop\agc1\wos-extract.isi,"Kuja-Halkola R, 2012, V24, P739, DOI 10.1017/S095457941200034X"
"Acute ethanol-induced locomotor stimulation and ethanol-induced locomotor sensitization are two behavioral assays thought to model the rewarding effects of ethanol. Recent evidence suggests that GS39783, a GABA(B) positive allosteric modulator, may be effective at reducing both the rewarding and reinforcing effects of several drugs of abuse, including ethanol. The goal of this study was to determine if GS39783 was capable of altering acute ethanol-induced stimulation, and the induction and expression of ethanol-induced locomotor sensitization, without effecting basal locomotion levels. Several doses of GS39783 (ranging from 0 to 100 mg/kg, depending on experiment) were tested on adult male DBA/2J mice in four experiments using 3-day basal locomotion and acute ethanol stimulation paradigms, and 14-day induction and expression of ethanol sensitization paradigms. The results of experiment 1 are in agreement with current literature, suggesting that 30 mg/kg doses of GS39783 and lower do not alter basal locomotor activity. In experiment 2, we found that GS39783 significantly decreased acute ethanol stimulation, but only at the 30 mg/kg dose, supporting our hypothesis and other publications suggesting that GABA(B) receptors modulate acute ethanol stimulation. Contrary to our hypothesis, GS39783 did not alter the expression of locomotor sensitization. Additionally, repeated administration of GS39783 in conjunction with ethanol unexpectedly potentiated ethanol-induced locomotor sensitization. Further study of GS39783 is warranted as it may be a more tolerable treatment for alcoholism than full agonists, due to its behavioral efficacy at doses that lack sedative side effects. Our results add to current literature suggesting that the GABA(B) receptor system is indeed involved in the modulation of ethanol-induced locomotor stimulation and sensitization.

"Background. Although many studies indicate that maternal smoking during pregnancy (SDP) is correlated with later offspring antisocial behavior (ASB), recent quasi-experimental studies suggest that background familial factors confound the association. The present study sought to test alternative etiological hypotheses using multiple indices of adolescent ASB, comparing differentially exposed siblings, and testing assumptions in the sibling-comparison design. Method. The study examined the association between maternal SDP and adolescent-reported ASB, criminal convictions and membership in a group of individuals with early-starting and chronic ASB among 6066 offspring of women from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth, a representative sample of women in the USA. The analyses controlled for statistical covariates and examined associations while comparing differentially exposed siblings. Results. At the population level, each additional pack of cigarettes per day predicted greater mean adolescent-reported ASB symptoms [ratio of means 1.15, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.08-1.22], odds of being in the top 10% of ASB [odds ratio (OR) 1.34, 95% CI 1.10-1.65], hazard of a criminal conviction [hazard ratio (HR) 1.51, 95% CI 1.34-1.68] and odds of chronic ASB (OR 1.57, 95% CI 1.25-1.99). SDP robustly predicted most assessments of ASB while controlling for measured covariates. When siblings exposed to differing levels of SDP were compared, however, all of the associations were attenuated and were not statistically significant : adolescent-reported mean ASB (ratio of means 0.86, 95% CI 0.74-1.01), high ASB (OR 0.67, 95% CI 0.41-1.12), criminal conviction (HR 0.98, 95% CI 0.66-1.44) and chronic ASB (OR 0.80, 95% CI 0.46-1.38). Conclusions. The results strongly suggest that familial factors account for the correlation between SDP and offspring adolescent ASB, rather than a putative causal environmental influence of SDP.",,,"D'Onofrio, BM|Goodnight, JA|Lahey, BB|Rathouz, PJ|Van Hulle, CA","D'Onofrio, Brian M.|Goodnight, Jackson A.|Lahey, Benjamin B.|Rathouz, Paul J.|Van Hulle, Carol A.",1535,-1,,,,,,,-1,,-1,,,,,,,,Article,10.1017/S0033291711002443,,,,1545,Clarivate Analytics Web of Science,,,,,,0033-2917,7,,,PSYCHOLOGICAL MEDICINE,,,,NATIONAL LONGITUDINAL SURVEY|PRENATAL ALCOHOL EXPOSURE|EXTERNALIZING PROBLEMS|OUTCOMES|YOUTH|HYPOTHESES|DESIGN|TRAJECTORIES|CHILDREN|NICOTINE,-1,,Antisocial behavior|criminality|nicotine|pregnancy|smoking,,JUL,J,2012,,,,,,"Psychology, Clinical|Psychiatry|Psychology",,-1,,Psychology; Psychiatry,,27,Is maternal smoking during pregnancy a causal environmental risk factor for adolescent antisocial behavior?

"Background. Maternal smoking during pregnancy (SDP) has been studied extensively as a risk factor for adverse offspring outcomes and is known to co-occur with other familial risk factors. Accounting for general familial risk factors has attenuated associations between SDP and adverse offspring outcomes, and identifying these confounds will be crucial to elucidating the relationship between SDP and its psychological correlates. Method. The current study aimed to disentangle the relationship between maternal SDP and co-occurring risk factors (maternal criminal activity, drug problems, teen pregnancy, educational attainment, and cohabitation at childbirth) using a population-based sample of full- (n = 206 313) and half-sister pairs (n = 19 363) from Sweden. Logistic regression models estimated the strength of association between SDP and co-occurring risk factors. Bivariate behavioral genetic models estimated the degree to which associations between SDP and co-occurring risk factors are attributable to genetic and environmental factors. Results. Maternal SDP was associated with an increase in all co-occurring risk factors. Of the variance associated with SDP, 45% was attributed to genetic factors and 53% was attributed to unshared environmental factors. In bivariate models, genetic factors accounted for 21% (non-drug-, non-violence-related crimes) to 35% (drug-related crimes) of the covariance between SDP and co-occurring risk factors. Unshared environmental factors accounted for the remaining covariance. Conclusions. The genetic factors that influence a woman's criminal behavior, substance abuse and her offspring's rearing environment all influence SDP. Therefore, the intergenerational transmission of genes conferring risk for antisocial behavior and substance misuse may influence the associations between maternal SDP and adverse offspring outcomes.",,,"D'Onofrio, BM|Ellingson, JM|Langstorm, N|Lichtenstein, P|Rickert, ME","D'Onofrio, Brian M.|Ellingson, Jarrod M.|Langstorm, Niklas|Lichtenstein, Paul|Rickert, Martin",1547,-1,,,,,,,-1,,-1,,,,,,,,Article,10.1017/S0033291711002534,,,,1557,Clarivate Analytics Web of Science,,,,,,0033-2917,7,,,PSYCHOLOGICAL MEDICINE,,,,DEFICIT HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER|PRENATAL SMOKING|ANTISOCIAL-BEHAVIOR|LATE ADOLESCENCE|CONDUCT PROBLEMS|EXPOSURE|CAUSAL|PSYCHOPATHOLOGY|ATTENTION|ADULTHOOD,-1,"lichtenstein, paul/0000-0003-3037-5287",Antisocial|behavior genetics|criminal|drug|pregnancy|smoking,,JUL,J,2012,,,,,,"Psychology, Clinical|Psychiatry|Psychology",,-1,,Psychology; Psychiatry,,18,Disentangling the relationships between maternal smoking during pregnancy and co-occurring risk factors,18,,WOS:000304441500019,1,42,1469-8978,22115276,C:\Users\mginda\Desktop\agc1\wos-extract.isi,"Ellingson JM, 2012, V42, P1547, DOI 10.1017/S0033291711002534"
"Objective Inadequate participant recruitment is a major problem facing clinical research. Recent studies have demonstrated that electronic health record (EHR)-based, point-of-care, clinical trial alerts (CTA) can improve participant recruitment to certain clinical research studies. Despite their promise, much remains to be learned about the use of CTAs. Our objective was to study whether repeated exposure to such alerts leads to declining user responsiveness and to characterize its extent if present to better inform future CTA deployments. Methods During a 36-week study period, we systematically documented the response patterns of 178 physician users randomized to receive CTAs for an ongoing clinical trial. Data were collected on: (1) response rates to the CTA; and (2) referral rates per physician, per time unit. Variables of interest were offset by the log of the total number of alerts received by that physician during that time period, in a Poisson regression. Results Response rates demonstrated a significant downward trend across time, with response rates decreasing by 2.7% for each advancing time period, significantly different from zero (flat) (p<0.0001). Even after 36 weeks, response rates remained in the 30%-40% range. Subgroup analyses revealed differences between community-based versus university-based physicians (p=0.0489). Discussion CTA responsiveness declined gradually over prolonged exposure, although it remained reasonably high even after 36 weeks of exposure. There were also notable differences between community-based versus university-based users. Conclusions These findings add to the limited literature on this form of EHR-based alert fatigue and should help inform future tailoring, deployment, and further study of CTAs.",,"Embi, Peter/E-3030-2011","Embi, PJ|Leonard, AC","Embi, Peter J.|Leonard, Anthony C.",E145,-1,,,,,,,-1,,-1,,,,,,,,Article,10.1136/amiajnl-2011-000743,,,,E148,Clarivate Analytics Web of Science,,,,,,1067-5027,E1,,,JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MEDICAL INFORMATICS ASSOCIATION,,,,PHYSICIAN PARTICIPATION|CARE|RECRUITMENT|BARRIERS,-1,,,,JUN,J,2012,,,,,,"Computer Science, Information Systems|Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications|Health Care Sciences & Services|Information Science & Library Science|Medical Informatics",,-1,,Computer Science; Health Care Sciences & Services; Information Science & Library Science; Medical Informatics,,51,Evaluating alert fatigue over time to EHR-based clinical trial alerts: findings from a randomized controlled study,51,,WOS:000314151400024,1,19,1527-974X,22534081,C:\Users\mginda\Desktop\agc1\wos-extract.isi,"Embi PJ, 2012, V19, E145, DOI 10.1136/amiajnl-2011-000743"
"Research has demonstrated that adolescent peer group affiliations are consistent predictors of substance use initiation and maintenance; it is less clear how adolescent romantic relationships influence substance use behavior. Data were drawn from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health. Participants in the final dataset for the current study included adolescents (321 males and 321 females) who were identified in reciprocated romantic relationships at Wave 1 (1994-1995; mean age 16.7 years) that were followed into young adulthood and reassessed at two different time points (Wave 2 in 1996, mean age 17.7, and Wave 3 in 2001-2002, mean age 23.1). Data were gathered from both partners, and included demographic variables, longitudinal measures of substance use (alcohol, tobacco, and marijuana), and relationship seriousness. Hierarchical linear modeling using SAS PROC MIXED were utilized to test for individual versus partner influences. Results revealed individual and partner effects for the prediction of alcohol and tobacco, although individual effects were generally greater than partner influences. For marijuana use, as self-reported relationship seriousness increased, future marijuana use decreased. These findings suggest the developmental significance of adolescent romantic relationships on the prediction of future substance use behavior during young adulthood.

"Information technology (IT) to support clinical research has steadily grown over the past 10 years. Many new applications at the enterprise level are available to assist with the numerous tasks necessary in performing clinical research. However, it is not clear how rapidly this technology is being adopted or whether it is making an impact upon how clinical research is being performed. The Clinical Research Forum's IT Roundtable performed a survey of 17 representative academic medical centers (AMCs) to understand the adoption rate and implementation strategies within this field. The results were compared with similar surveys from 4 and 6 years ago. We found the adoption rate for four prominent areas of IT-supported clinical research had increased remarkably, specifically regulatory compliance, electronic data capture for clinical trials, data repositories for secondary use of clinical data, and infrastructure for supporting collaboration. Adoption of other areas of clinical research IT was more irregular with wider differences between AMCs. These differences appeared to be partially due to a set of openly available applications that have emerged to occupy an important place in the landscape of clinical research enterprise-level support at AMC's.

"Background: Clinical trials are the primary mechanism for advancing clinical care and evidenced-based practice, yet challenges with the recruitment of participants for such trials are widely recognized as a major barrier to these types of studies. Data warehouses (DW) store large amounts of heterogenous clinical data that can be used to enhance recruitment practices, but multiple challenges exist when using a data warehouse for such activities, due to the manner of collection, management, integration, analysis, and dissemination of the data. A critical step in leveraging the DW for recruitment purposes is being able to match trial eligibility criteria to discrete and semi-structured data types in the data warehouse, though trial eligibility criteria tend to be written without concern for their computability. We present the multi-modal evaluation of a web-based tool that can be used for pre-screening patients for clinical trial eligibility and assess the ability of this tool to be practically used for clinical research pre-screening and recruitment. Methods: The study used a validation study, usability testing, and a heuristic evaluation to evaluate and characterize the operational characteristics of the software as well as human factors affecting its use. Results: Clinical trials from the Division of Cardiology and the Department of Family Medicine were used for this multi-modal evaluation, which included a validation study, usability study, and a heuristic evaluation. From the results of the validation study, the software demonstrated a positive predictive value (PPV) of 54.12% and 0.7%, respectively, and a negative predictive value (NPV) of 73.3% and 87.5%, respectively, for two types of clinical trials. Heuristic principles concerning error prevention and documentation were characterized as the major usability issues during the heuristic evaluation. Conclusions: This software is intended to provide an initial list of eligible patients to a clinical study coordinators, which provides a starting point for further eligibility screening by the coordinator. Because this software has a high ""rule in"" ability, meaning that it is able to remove patients who are not eligible for the study, the use of an automated tool built to leverage an existing enterprise DW can be beneficial to determining eligibility and facilitating clinical trial recruitment through pre-screening. While the results of this study are promising, further refinement and study of this and related approaches to automated eligibility screening, including comparison to other approaches and stakeholder perceptions, are needed and future studies are planned to address these needs.",,"Yen, Po-Yin/E-4351-2011; Embi, Peter/E-3030-2011","Ding, J|Embi, PJ|Liu, JH|Payne, PRO|Pressler, TR|Yen, PY","Ding, Jing|Embi, Peter J.|Liu, Jianhua|Payne, Philip R.

"Background: The acute locomotor effects of voluntary ethanol (EtOH) intake in mice (stimulation/sedation) might be important behavioral indicators of an animals propensity to engage in EtOH consumption and/or EtOH seeking behaviors. Using a binge-like EtOH intake model dubbed Drinking-in-the-Dark (DID), we recently observed home cage locomotor stimulation in C57BL/6J mice during an acute EtOH intake session, but acute home cage locomotor sedation following repeated EtOH exposures. To determine the role of novelty and/or EtOH history on these previously described locomotor effects, and to determine the relationship between these variables on locomotor activity immediately following DID intake, we conducted 2 separate experiments. Methods: In experiment 1, mice were given access to either EtOH or water, and locomotor activity was monitored immediately afterwards. In experiment 2, mice were given 13 days access to EtOH or water solution while home cage locomotor activity was monitored. On the 14th day, half of the water consuming animals received EtOH access for the first time. On the 15th day, all animals received EtOH access, and locomotion was assessed afterwards in locomotor activity testing chambers. Results: In experiment 1, locomotor activity following DID was positively associated with EtOH intake and blood EtOH concentrations (BECs). In experiment 2, the group that received EtOH for the first time on the 14th day did not display locomotor stimulation. Locomotor activity following DID EtOH intake was positively associated with BECs in all groups regardless of EtOH history. Conclusions: These results suggest that (i) DID-induced locomotor stimulation in the home cage may involve relative familiarity with the DID procedures, and (ii) locomotor stimulation immediately following DID is directly related to the relative concentration of EtOH in blood; an effect that is not altered by prior EtOH history. These data add new evidence of the pharmacological actions of binge-like EtOH intake, and provide a basis by which we may explore the motivation and consequences of such binge consumption.",,,"Boehm, SL|Linsenbardt, DN","Boehm, Stephen L., II|Linsenbardt, David N.",887,-1,,,,,,,-1,,-1,,,,,,,,Article,10.1111/j.1530-0277.2011.01684.x,,,,894,Clarivate Analytics Web of Science,,,,,,0145-6008,5,,,ALCOHOLISM-CLINICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL RESEARCH,,,,AMPHETAMINE|SENSITIVITY|MICE,-1,,Alcohol|Mouse|Ethanol|Binge|Locomotor,,MAY,J,2012,,,,,,Substance Abuse,,-1,,Substance Abuse,,9,Role of Novelty and Ethanol History in Locomotor Stimulation Induced by Binge-Like Ethanol Intake,9,,WOS:000303388500017,1,36,,22150802,C:\Users\mginda\Desktop\agc1\wos-extract.isi,"Linsenbardt DN, 2012, V36, P887, DOI 10.1111/j.1530-0277.2011.01684.x"
"Most models exploring adolescent health behavior have focused on individual influences to understand behavior change. The goal of the current study was to assess the role of adolescent romantic partners on the expression of health behavior. Our sample utilized two waves of data from the US National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, which included 80 romantic dyads (160 individuals). A longitudinal multilevel analysis was conducted. We assessed individual and romantic partner health-harming behaviors (i.e., delinquency, alcohol use, smoking, and marijuana use), health-protective behaviors (i.e., physical activity, physical inactivity, sleep patterns, seatbelt use, and contraception motivations), as well as the role of gender and age. Participants average age was 16 years at baseline. We found evidence for partner similarity and partner influence with the majority of health-harming behaviors. Specifically, partner influence was evident for smoking and alcohol use with partner influence approaching significance for marijuana use. We found limited evidence for partner similarity and partner influence for health-protective behaviors. The importance of assessing romantic dyads was evident in these data. Interventions focusing on health-harming behavior for adolescent populations are important public health goals. It is recommended that future intervention efforts with adolescent health-harming behaviors should target not only peers, but also consider the role of romantic partners. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

"Purpose: To understand how diversion of low-risk youth from juvenile detention affected screening practices for detained youth. Methods: In a 22-month cross-sectional study of 2,532 detainees (age, 13-18 years), mental health and sexually transmitted infection (STI) screening data were compared before and after the beginning of diversion efforts through implementation of a Risk Assessment Instrument (RAI). Results: Detention diversion resulted in a 30% census reduction. In a logistic regression, younger age (odds ratio [OR] = 1.10 for a 1-year increase; confidence interval [CI]: 1.03, 1.17), Hispanic versus white race/ethnicity (OR = .53; CI:.35,.82), and less severe crime (OR = .90 per 1 point; CI:.89,.91) predicted reduced likelihood of detention. Mental health and STI screening increased significantly after implementation of the RAI. Additionally, the rate of positive STI tests increased among detained males (9% pre-RAI to 14% after implementation of the RAI, p = .01). However, implementation of the RAI did not result in a significant increase in the number of positive mental health screens. Conclusions: Universal mental health and STI screening are increasingly common public health practices in detention centers. The results of this study indicate that juvenile justice diversion programming affects public health screening rates among detained youth in our population. Future study of the possible unintended consequences of criminal justice initiatives on public health outcomes is recommended. (C) 2012 Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine.

"Objectives: Previous studies suggest that maternal smoking during pregnancy is associated with elevated offspring blood pressure during childhood. We aimed to investigate whether this association remained in late adolescence and, if so, whether it could be attributed to an intrauterine effect or to familial confounding. Methods: We used a national cohort of 87 223 young Swedish men born between 1983 and 1988 with information on both maternal smoking during pregnancy and blood pressure at military conscription. The cohort included 780 full brothers discordant for maternal smoking. Generalized estimation equations were used to estimate regression coefficients (beta) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs). Results: We found a small but significant increase in both SBP and DBP for young men whose mothers had been daily smokers during pregnancy compared with sons of nonsmoking mothers: 0.26 (95% CI 0.09 to 0.44) and 0.45 mmHg (95% CI 0.31 to 0.59) for SBP and DBP, respectively. In a within-sibling analysis comparing full brothers discordant for maternal smoking exposure, point estimates were similar but not statistically significant: 0.85 (95% CI -0.19 to 1.90) for DBP and 0.81 (-0.56 to 2.19) for SBP. Conclusion: Maternal smoking during pregnancy is associated with a small but statistically significant increase in offspring blood pressure in late adolescence. Because the association does not appear to be explained by familial confounding, our results support an intrauterine effect of prenatal smoking exposure on blood pressure in late adolescence.",,,"Cnattingius, S|D'Onofrio, BM|Hogberg, L|Iliadou, AN|Langstorm, N|Lundholm, C","Cnattingius, Sven|D'Onofrio, Brian M.|Hogberg, Lovisa|Iliadou, Anastasia N.|Langstorm, Niklas|Lundholm, Cecilia",693,-1,,,,,,,-1,,-1,,,,,,,,Article,10.1097/HJH.0b013e32835168f4,,,,699,Clarivate Analytics Web of Science,,,,,,0263-6352,4,,,JOURNAL OF HYPERTENSION,,,,CARDIOVASCULAR-DISEASE|CIGARETTE-SMOKING|PRENATAL SMOKING|BIRTH COHORT|RISK-FACTORS|AGE|FETAL|ASSOCIATIONS|CHILDHOOD|OUTCOMES,-1,"Lundholm, Cecilia/0000-0002-6546-3650",adolescent|blood pressure|maternal smoking|prenatal exposure delayed effects|siblings,,APR,J,2012,,,,,,Peripheral Vascular Disease,,-1,,Cardiovascular System & Cardiology,,21,Effects of maternal smoking during pregnancy on offspring blood pressure in late adolescence,21,,WOS:000301744400014,1,30,1473-5598,22388229,C:\Users\mginda\Desktop\agc1\wos-extract.isi,"Hogberg L, 2012, V30, P693, DOI 10.1097/HJH.0b013e32835168f4"

"Background: Kenya experienced a political and humanitarian crisis after presidential elections on December 27, 2007. We sought to describe both the immediate and long-term impact of this conflict for HIV-infected children in western Kenya. Methods: We conducted a retrospective study of a cohort of these children for 3 periods: period 1, before the election (October 26, 2007, to December 25, 2007); period 2, immediately after the election (December 26, 2007, to April 15, 2008); and period 3, long-term postelection (April 16, 2008, to December 31, 2008). Two outcome variables of loss-to-follow-up (LTFU) were assessed: initial LTFU and complete LTFU. We assessed clinic adherence by evaluating the difference between actual visits and expected visits. Among children on antiretroviral therapy (ART), we assessed overall medication adherence and changes in medication adherence. Results: Two thousand five hundred forty-nine HIV-infected children,14 years were seen in period 1. Children on ART had less initial LTFU (3.0% compared with 5.1%, P < 0.01) and less complete LTFU (2.6% compared with 6.8%, P < 0.001) than children not on ART. For children not on ART, clinic adherence improved in period 3 compared with period 2. For children on ART with a more strict measure of clinic adherence, clinic adherence declined over time. Orphans had better clinic adherence than nonorphans. Among children on ART, there were few demographic differences when comparing medication adherence between time. Conclusions: HIV-infected children are at risk for disruptions in clinic follow-up and medication adherence after a humanitarian crisis. Individual and contextual factors moderate the effects of these disruptions.",,"Wiehe, Sarah/R-6083-2017","Ayaya, SO|Braitstein, P|Gisore, PO|Nyandiko, WM|Vreeman, RC|Wiehe, SE|Yoder, RB","Ayaya, Samwel O.|Braitstein, Paula|Gisore, Peter O.|Nyandiko, Winstone M.|Vreeman, Rachel C.|Wiehe, Sarah E.|Yoder, Rachel B.",199,-1,,,,,,,-1,,-1,,,,,,,,Article,10.1097/QAI.0b013e31823b4448,,,,206,Clarivate Analytics Web of Science,,,,,,1525-4135,2,,,JAIDS-JOURNAL OF ACQUIRED IMMUNE DEFICIENCY SYNDROMES,,,,SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA|ANTIRETROVIRAL THERAPY|EXPOSED CHILDREN|PEDIATRIC ADHERENCE|ARMED CONFLICT|FOLLOW-UP|OUTCOMES|CARE|POPULATION|SETTINGS,-1,"Wiehe, Sarah/0000-0002-8148-0848",HIV|medication adherence|pediatrics|postcrisis,,1-Feb,J,2012,,,,,,Immunology|Infectious Diseases,,-1,,Immunology; Infectious Diseases,,9,Long-Term Impact of the Kenya Postelection Crisis on Clinic Attendance and Medication Adherence for HIV-Infected Children in Western Kenya,9,,WOS:000299789600020,1,59,,22027872,C:\Users\mginda\Desktop\agc1\wos-extract.isi,"Yoder RB, 2012, V59, P199, DOI 10.1097/QAI.0b013e31823b4448"
"In the decade and a half since Coley and Chase-Lansdale's (1998) review of teenage childbearing, there have been a number of studies investigating teenage childbearing from a developmental psychological perspective. Many of these studies have focused primarily on identifying individual, familial, and socioeconomic risk factors in childhood and adolescence that are highly correlated with teenage sexual behavior and teenage childbearing. We have an emerging understanding of teenage childbearing as the culmination of a complex cascade of experiences and decisions that overlap greatly with the risks for antisocial behavior. Much of this research, however, is limited by its reliance on correlational and cross-sectional research designs, which are not able to rigorously test causal inferences or to identify mechanisms associated with teenage childbearing. Innovative studies using large, nationally representative samples with quasi-experimental and longitudinal designs can expand on such descriptive studies. In particular, quasi-experimental studies can help answer questions about which risk factors are causally associated with teenage childbearing and suggest potential mechanisms that can explain how teenage childbearing is associated with poor outcomes. Future studies also will need to incorporate more precise measures of developmental processes and explore heterogeneity among adolescent mothers. Although advances have been made in the psychological study of teenage childbearing, more research is needed in order to answer important questions about which psychological processes are causally related to teenage childbearing and how teenage childbearing is associated with poor outcomes for young mothers and their offspring.",,,"Coyne, CA|D'Onofrio, BM","Coyne, Claire A.|D'Onofrio, Brian M.",113,-1,,,,,,Advances in Child Development and Behavior,-1,,-1,,,,,,,,Review; Book Chapter,,,"Benson, JB",,152,Clarivate Analytics Web of Science,,,,978-0-12-394388-0,,0065-2407,,,,"ADVANCES IN CHILD DEVELOPMENT AND BEHAVIOR, VOL 42",,,,ADOLESCENT SEXUAL-BEHAVIOR|LIFE-COURSE-PERSISTENT|UNITED-STATES|YOUNG MOTHERS|CONTRACEPTIVE USE|MATERNAL AGE|SOCIAL CONTAGION|PREGNANCY RATES|SCHOOL-STUDENTS|FATHER ABSENCE,-1,,,,,S,2012,,,,,,"Psychology, Developmental",,-1,,Psychology,,31,SOME (BUT NOT MUCH) PROGRESS TOWARD UNDERSTANDING TEENAGE CHILDBEARING: A REVIEW OF RESEARCH FROM THE PAST DECADE,31,,WOS:000306816600005,1,42,,22675905,C:\Users\mginda\Desktop\agc1\wos-extract.isi,"Coyne CA, 2012, V42, P113"

"Recent nationwide initiatives to accelerate clinical and translational research, including comparative effectiveness research, will increasingly require clinician participation in research-related activities at the point-of-care, activities such as participant recruitment for clinical research studies and systematic data collection. A key element to the success of such initiatives that has not yet been adequately addressed is how to provide incentives to clinicians for the time and effort that such participation will require. Models to calculate the value of clinical care services are commonly used to compensate clinicians, and similar models have been proposed to calculate and compensate researchers' efforts. However, to the authors' knowledge, no such model has been proposed for calculating the value of research-related activities performed by noninvestigator-clinicians, be they in academic or community settings. In this commentary, the authors propose a new model for doing just that. They describe how such a relative research unit model could be used to provide both direct and indirect incentives for clinician participation in research activities. Direct incentives could include financial compensation, and indirect incentives could include credit toward promotion and tenure and toward the maintenance of specialty board certification. The authors discuss the principles behind this relative research unit approach as well as ethical, funding, and other considerations to fully developing and deploying such a model, across academic environments first and then more broadly across the health care community.",,"Embi, Peter/E-3030-2011","Embi, PJ|Tsevat, J","Embi, Peter J.|Tsevat, Joel",11,-1,,,,,,,-1,,-1,,,,,,,,Editorial Material,10.1097/ACM.0b013e31823a8d99,,,,14,Clarivate Analytics Web of Science,,,,,,1040-2446,1,,,ACADEMIC MEDICINE,,,,RECRUITMENT|FACULTY|SYSTEM,-1,,,,JAN,J,2012,,,,,,"Education, Scientific Disciplines|Health Care Sciences & Services",,-1,,Education & Educational Research; Health Care Sciences & Services,,11,Commentary: The Relative Research Unit: Providing Incentives for Clinician Participation in Research Activities,11,,WOS:000298665300010,1,87,1938-808X,22201633,C:\Users\mginda\Desktop\agc1\wos-extract.isi,"Embi PJ, 2012, V87, P11, DOI 10.1097/ACM.0b013e31823a8d99"
"Background. Offspring of patients with schizophrenia exhibit poorer school performance compared with offspring of non-schizophrenic parents. We aimed to elucidate the mechanisms behind this association. Method. We linked longitudinal national population registers in Sweden and compared school performance among offspring of schizophrenic parents with offspring of non-schizophrenic parents (1 439 215 individuals with final grades from compulsory school 1988-2006). To investigate the mechanisms, we studied offspring of schizophrenic patients and controls within the same extended families. We investigated genetic effects by stratifying analyses of parent-child associations according to genetic relatedness (half-cousins, full cousins and half-siblings). Environmental effects were investigated by comparing school performance of offspring of schizophrenic fathers and of schizophrenic mothers, respectively, and by stratifying the analyses according to environmental relatedness while controlling genetic relatedness (paternal and maternal half-cousins, paternal and maternal half-siblings). Results. Offspring of parents with schizophrenia had poorer overall school performance than unrelated offspring of non-schizophrenic parents (-0.31 S.D.). Variability in genetic relatedness greatly moderated the strength of thew within-family association (beta=-0.23 within exposure-discordant half-cousins, beta=-0.13 within exposure-discordant full cousins, beta=0.04 within exposure-discordant half-siblings), while no evidence was found that the environment affected offspring school performance. Conclusions. Genetic factors account for poorer school performance in children of parents with schizophrenia. This supports that cognitive deficits found in individuals with schizophrenia and their relatives might be genetically inherited. Early detection of prodromal signs and impaired functioning of offspring of patients with schizophrenia could lead to earlier and better tailored interventions.",,,"D'Onofrio, BM|Hultman, CM|Jundong, J|Kuja-Halkola, R|Langstorm, N|Lichtenstein, P","D'Onofrio, Brian M.|Hultman, Christina M.|Jundong, J.|Kuja-Halkola, Ralf|Langstorm, Niklas|Lichtenstein, Paul",111,-1,,,,,,,-1,,-1,,,,,,,,Article,10.1017/S0033291711001127,,,,123,Clarivate Analytics Web of Science,,,,,,0033-2917,1,,,PSYCHOLOGICAL MEDICINE,,,,HIGH-RISK CHILDREN|ADULT SCHIZOPHRENIA|NATIONAL COHORT|BIRTH COHORT|CHILDHOOD|BEHAVIOR|AGE|ABNORMALITIES|ACHIEVEMENT|ETIOLOGY,-1,"Kuja-Halkola, Ralf/0000-0002-3765-2067; lichtenstein, paul/0000-0003-3037-5287",Environments|genetics|offspring|schizophrenia|school performance,,JAN,J,2012,,,,,,"Psychology, Clinical|Psychiatry|Psychology",,-1,,Psychology; Psychiatry,,10,Poor school performance in offspring of patients with schizophrenia: what are the mechanisms?,10,,WOS:000298961600010,1,42,,21733288,C:\Users\mginda\Desktop\agc1\wos-extract.isi,"Jundong J, 2012, V42, P111, DOI 10.1017/S0033291711001127"

"The purpose of this study was to investigate alcohol use attitudes as a mediator of the relationship between religiosity and the frequency of past month alcohol use in a national sample of adolescents. Data were drawn from 18,314 adolescents who participated in the 2006 and 2007 National Survey on Drug Use and Health. Variables included religiosity, alcohol use attitudes, and past month frequency of alcohol use. Structural equation modeling was used to test alcohol use attitudes as a mediator of the relationship between religiosity and frequency of alcohol use and to test model invariance across 4 racial/ethnic groups. Results suggest that alcohol use attitudes partially mediate the relationship between religiosity and frequency of alcohol use. Furthermore, while the pattern of these relationships is similar across racial/ethnic groups, the magnitude of alcohol use attitudes on frequency of alcohol use differed. Implications for prevention programs include targeting alcohol use attitudes in a variety of settings.",,,"de Dios, MA|Kratz, LM|Steinfeldt, JA|Vaughan, EL","de Dios, Marcel A.|Kratz, Lisa M.|Steinfeldt, Jesse A.|Vaughan, Ellen L.",547,-1,,,,,,,-1,,-1,,,,,,,,Article,10.1037/a0024660,,,,553,Clarivate Analytics Web of Science,,,,,,0893-164X,3,,,PSYCHOLOGY OF ADDICTIVE BEHAVIORS,,,,SUBSTANCE USE|MARIJUANA|MEDIATORS|DRINKING,-1,,religiosity|attitudes about alcohol use|alcohol|racial/ethnic differences,,SEP,J,2011,,,,,,"Substance Abuse|Psychology, Multidisciplinary",,-1,,Substance Abuse; Psychology,,16,"Religiosity, Alcohol Use Attitudes, and Alcohol Use in a National Sample of Adolescents",18,,WOS:000295404100018,1,25,,21766976,C:\Users\mginda\Desktop\agc1\wos-extract.isi,"Vaughan EL, 2011, V25, P547, DOI 10.1037/a0024660"
"Linking electronic health record (EHR) systems with community information systems (CIS) holds great promise for addressing inequities in social determinants of health (SDH). While EHRs are rich in location-specific data that allow us to uncover geographic inequities in health outcomes, CIS are rich in data that allow us to describe community-level characteristics relating to health. When meaningfully integrated, these data systems enable clinicians, researchers, and public health professionals to actively address the social etiologies of health disparities. This article describes a process for exploring SDH by geocoding and integrating EHR data with a comprehensive CIS covering a large metropolitan area. Because the systems were initially designed for different purposes and had different teams of experts involved in their development, integrating them presents challenges that require multidisciplinary expertise in informatics, geography, public health, and medicine. We identify these challenges and the means of addressing them and discuss the significance of the project as a model for similar projects.",,"Wiehe, Sarah/R-6083-2017; Dixon, Brian/A-9494-2013","Bodenhamer, DJ|Comer, KF|Dixon, BE|Grannis, S|Wiehe, SE","Bodenhamer, David J.|Comer, Karen Frederickson|Dixon, Brian E.|Grannis, Shaun|Wiehe, Sarah E.",54,-1,,,,,,,-1,,-1,,,,,,,,Article,10.1177/00333549111260S310,,,,61,Clarivate Analytics Web of Science,,,,,,0033-3549,,,,PUBLIC HEALTH REPORTS,,,,SEXUALLY-TRANSMITTED INFECTIONS|RISK-FACTORS|CORRECTIONAL FACILITIES|CHLAMYDIA-TRACHOMATIS|INFORMATION-SYSTEMS|UNITED-STATES|JAILED WOMEN|GONORRHEA|NEIGHBORHOODS|EPIDEMIOLOGY,-1,"Wiehe, Sarah/0000-0002-8148-0848; Dixon, Brian/0000-0002-1121-0607",,,SEP-OCT,J,2011,,,,,,"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health",,-1,,"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health",3,20,Incorporating Geospatial Capacity within Clinical Data Systems to Address Social Determinants of Health,20,,WOS:000294573800010,1,126,1468-2877,21836738,C:\Users\mginda\Desktop\agc1\wos-extract.isi,"Comer KF, 2011, V126, P54, DOI 10.1177/00333549111260S310"
"Prisoner reentry is a stressful process and many prisoners return to behaviors that led to incarceration upon community reentry. We assess how individual-level vulnerabilities interact with system-level barriers that impact the community reentry process. An additional area explored was the impact of reentry services on risk behavior (i.e., sexual risk and substance use). Fifty-one (22 men, 29 women) primarily minority adults returning from the county jail or state prison participated in 4 focus groups in Febuary 2010. Participants took part in tape-recorded focus groups facilitated by research staff trained in qualitative research methodology. Participants reported that a lack of discharge planning led to poor community reentry (basic needs such as stable housing and employment were not met). As a result of a difficulty in accessing services to meet basic needs, many participants used drugs or engaged in sex for drugs, money, or transportation early in the community reentry process. Given the individual-level vulnerabilities of prisoners, they are more likely to reengage in risk behavior, which increases the risk of acquiring and transmitting HIV, reengaging in substance use, and recidivism. In summary, discharge planning should focus not only on sexual and substance use risk reduction, but also confirm that basic needs are met soon, if not immediately, upon release and subsequent community reentry.",,"dehnavi, leila/F-2134-2013","Aalsma, MC|Holloway, ED|Luther, JB|Reichert, ES|Roth, AM","Aalsma, Matthew C.|Holloway, Evan D.|Luther, James B.|Reichert, Erica S.|Roth, Alexis M.",475,-1,,,,,,,-1,,-1,,,,,,,,Article,10.1089/apc.2010.0372,,,,481,Clarivate Analytics Web of Science,,,,,,1087-2914,8,,,AIDS PATIENT CARE AND STDS,,,,HIV|HEALTH|INMATES|JAIL|INTERVENTION|CONSEQUENCES|PREDICTORS|HOME|MEN,-1,"Holloway, Evan/0000-0002-6888-8398",,,AUG,J,2011,,,,,,"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health|Infectious Diseases",,-1,,"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health; Infectious Diseases",,31,An Exploration of Community Reentry Needs and Services for Prisoners: A Focus on Care to Limit Return to High-Risk Behavior,31,,WOS:000293265500005,1,25,,21663540,C:\Users\mginda\Desktop\agc1\wos-extract.isi,"Luther JB, 2011, V25, P475, DOI 10.1089/apc.2010.0372"
"Purpose: The purpose of this study was to explore the experience of experienced users of computerized patient documentation for the purpose of collaboration and coordination. A secondary analysis of qualitative data using Clark's theoretical framework of communication was conducted with the goal of bringing research findings into design. Methods: Physicians, nurses and administrative staff volunteered to participate in focus groups at 4 VA sites. Each focus group lasted 1.5 h and targeted experience and issues with using computerized documentation. All focus groups were audio-taped and transcribed and submitted to extensive qualitative analysis using ATLAS, iterative identification of concepts and categories. The communication category was targeted for secondary theoretical analysis in order to deepen understanding of the findings. Clark's theory of communication, joint action and common ground heuristics was used to analyze concepts. Results: Key concepts included: (1) CPD has changed the way that narrative documentation is used in clinical settings to include more communication functions, strategies to establish joint action in both negative and positive ways; (2) functionality added to CPD to increase the efficiency of input may have increased the efficiency of CPD to support shared situation models, joint and action and the establishment of common ground; (3) new usage of CPD may increase tensions between clinical and administrative roles as the role of narrative is re-defined. Conclusions: This study demonstrates how socio-technical systems co-evolve to support essential human function of coordination and collaboration. Users adapted the system in unique and useful ways that provide insight to future development.

"Background. Associations between parental depression and offspring affective and disruptive disorders are well documented. Few genetically informed studies have explored the processes underlying intergenerational associations. Method. A semi-structured interview assessing DSM-III-R psychiatric disorders was administered to twins (n=1296) from the Australian Twin Register (ATR), their spouses (n=1046) and offspring (n=2555). We used the Children of Twins (CoT) design to delineate the extent to which intergenerational associations were consistent with a causal influence or due to genetic confounds. Results. In between-family analyses, parental depression was associated significantly with offspring depression [hazard ratio (HR) 1.52, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.20-1.93] and conduct disorder (CD; HR 2.27, CI 1.31-3.93). Survival analysis indicated that the intergenerational transmission of depression is consistent with a causal (environmental) inference, with a significant intergenerational association in offspring of discordant monozygotic (MZ) twin pairs (HR 1.39, CI 1.00-1.94). Logistic regression analysis suggested that the parental depression-offspring CD association was due to shared genetic liability in the parents and offspring. No intergenerational association was found when comparing the offspring of discordant MZ twins [odds ratio (OR) 1.41, CI 0.63-3.14], but offspring of discordant dizygotic (DZ) twins differed in their rates of CD (OR 2.53, CI 0.95-6.76). All findings remained after controlling for several measured covariates, including history of depression and CD in the twins' spouses. Conclusions.

"Background: Tolerance to the behavioral and subjective effects of alcohol (ethanol) is thought to be a major predictive factor for the development of alcoholism. Evidence from rodent models has supported this view with those animals most likely to develop tolerance generally drinking and preferring ethanol more so than those resistant to it. Despite this evidence, very little is known about the behavioral relationships between ethanol-induced tolerance and consumption. The goal of this study was to evaluate the development of tolerance to the ataxic effects of ethanol using a mouse model of binge-like intake dubbed ""Drinking in the Dark"" (DID; Physiol Behav 2005, 84:53-63). We hypothesized that mice would become tolerant to the ataxic effects of ethanol as this behavior is known to be altered at the blood ethanol concentrations reached using this model (>= 80 mg/dl). Methods: To evaluate this, we gave daily DID ethanol or water access sessions to male C57BL/6J (B6) mice and monitored ataxia (and in some cases locomotion) at various time points. Results: In general, mice given 14 consecutive days of ethanol access displayed tolerance to the ataxic effects of ethanol compared to water-drinking controls. These effects were coupled with alterations in locomotor behavior and in some cases differences in ethanol pharmacokinetics. Conclusions: Thus, we can conclude that tolerance to the behavioral effects of binge-like ethanol intake might play a key role in the daily maintenance of this behavior and that these effects may be evidence of important neuroadaptations involved in the development of alcoholism.",,,"Boehm, SL|Gigante, ED|Griffin, KD|Linsenbardt, DN|Moore, EM","Boehm, Stephen L., II|Gigante, Eduardo D.|Griffin, Kevar D.|Linsenbardt, David N.|Moore, Eileen M.",1246,-1,,,,,,,-1,,-1,,,,,,,,Article,10.1111/j.1530-0277.2011.01459.x,,,,1255,Clarivate Analytics Web of Science,,,,,,0145-6008,7,,,ALCOHOLISM-CLINICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL RESEARCH,,,,C57BL/6J MICE|ALCOHOL-DRINKING|INBRED MICE|LONG-SLEEP|SENSITIVITY|INTOXICATION|RATS,-1,,Binge|Alcohol|Tolerance|Ataxia|Locomotor|Mouse|Ethanol,,JUL,J,2011,,,,,,Substance Abuse,,-1,,Substance Abuse,,22,Tolerance to Ethanol's Ataxic Effects and Alterations in Ethanol-Induced Locomotion Following Repeated Binge-Like Ethanol Intake Using the DID Model,22,,WOS:000292109500007,1,35,,21410484,C:\Users\mginda\Desktop\agc1\wos-extract.isi,"Linsenbardt DN, 2011, V35, P1246, DOI 10.1111/j.1530-0277.2011.01459.x"
"Background: Animal models that explore differential sensitivity to the effects of acute and repeated exposure of alcohol (ethanol) may be influenced by both the developmental and genetic profile of the population. Therefore, we sought to compare the influence of ontogeny on sensitivity to ethanol-induced locomotor stimulation and on the induction of locomotor sensitization to this effect across 2 inbred strains of mice; the ethanol consuming C57BL/6J and the ethanol avoiding DBA/2J strains. Methods: C57BL/6J and DBA/2J adults (postnatal day [PD] 60 to 80) and adolescents (PD 30 + 2) were assessed for basal activity, acute response to 2.0 g/kg ethanol, and the expression of locomotor sensitization following repeated administration of 2.5, 3.0, or 3.5 g/kg ethanol. Results: Basal activity was different across development for the C57BL/6J, but not DBA/2J, with adult B6 mice showing persistently greater baseline activity. Adolescents of both strains were more sensitive than adults to acute ethanol-induced locomotor stimulation; adults exhibited a decrease in their acute response across the testing session. Adolescent DBA/2J mice developed less ethanol sensitization compared to adults, with significant sensitization observed only following repeated administration of the lowest ethanol dose (2.5 g/kg), whereas DBA/2J adults sensitized to all doses. Age did not influence the development of ethanol sensitization for the C57BL/6J strain, as both adults and adolescents displayed a sensitized response following all ethanol doses. Conclusions: These results suggest that the developmental pattern of locomotor sensitivity to ethanol is unique to the genotypic profile of the animal model.",,"Melon, Laverne/B-8208-2013","Boehm, SL|Melon, LC","Boehm, Stephen L., II|Melon, Laverne C.",1351,-1,,,,,,,-1,,-1,,,,,,,,Article,10.1111/j.1530-0277.2011.01471.x,,,,1360,Clarivate Analytics Web of Science,,,,,,0145-6008,7,,,ALCOHOLISM-CLINICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL RESEARCH,,,,BEHAVIORAL SENSITIZATION|DECREASED SENSITIVITY|VOLUNTARY ETHANOL|FAMILY-HISTORY|BRAIN|RISK|MODULATION|TOLERANCE|DRINKING|PREFERENCE,-1,"Melon, Laverne/0000-0002-2256-3707",Sensitization|Stimulation|Ethanol|Adolescence|Inbred Mouse Strain,,JUL,J,2011,,,,,,Substance Abuse,,-1,,Substance Abuse,,30,Role of Genotype in the Development of Locomotor Sensitization to Alcohol in Adult and Adolescent Mice: Comparison of the DBA/2J and C57BL/6J Inbred Mouse Strains,32,,WOS:000292109500019,1,35,,21410489,C:\Users\mginda\Desktop\agc1\wos-extract.isi,"Melon LC, 2011, V35, P1351, DOI 10.1111/j.1530-0277.2011.01471.x"
"GABA(A) receptors have been shown to modulate dopaminergic output from the ventral tegmental area (VTA) in studies of both natural and drug rewards, including alcohol. Ro15-4513, the imidazobenzodiazepine derivative and allosteric modulator at the GABA(A) receptor, reliably antagonizes the behavioral effects of alcohol. Various models of alcohol consumption show a decrease in consummatory behaviors, specific to ethanol, following acute administration of the drug. In the present study, Ro15-4513 was systemically administered, or microinjected into the anterior or posterior VTA, to explore the role of GABA(A) receptors at this region in modulating the high pattern of alcohol consumption by C57BL/6J inbred mice in the Drinking in the Dark (DID) model. Animals had 2 h access to ethanol for 6 days prior to drug manipulations. Immediately before the seventh day of access, mice were systemically (I.P.) or site-specifically administered Ro15-4513. Systemic Ro15-4513 (at 10 mg/kg) decreased binge-like ethanol intake in the DID paradigm. Additionally, there was a stepwise decrease in consumption following Ro15-4513 microinjection into the posterior VTA, with the highest dose significantly decreasing ethanol intake. There was no effect found following microinjection into the anterior VTA, nor was there an effect of systemic or intra-posterior VTA Ro15-4513 on consumption of a 5% sucrose solution or water. The present findings support a role for Ro15-4513 sensitive VTA-GABA(A) receptors in modulating binge-like ethanol consumption. Moreover, the work here adds to the growing body of literature suggesting regional heterogeneity in the VTA. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

"Genetic factors are important for the association between parental negativity and child problem behavior, but it is not clear whether this is due to passive or evocative genotype environment correlation (rGE). In this study, we applied the extended children-of-twins model to directly examine the presence of passive and evocative rGE as well as direct environmental effects in the association between parental criticism and adolescent externalizing problem behavior. The cross-sectional data come from the Twin and Offspring Study in Sweden (N = 909 pairs of adult twins) and from the Twin Study of Child and Adolescent Development (N = 915 pairs of twin children). The results revealed that maternal criticism was primarily due to evocative rGE emanating from their adolescent's externalizing behavior. On the other hand, fathers' critical remarks tended to affect adolescent problem behavior in a direct environmental way. This suggests that previously reported differences in caretaking between mothers and fathers also are reflected in differences in why parenting is associated with externalizing behavior in offspring.",,,"Andershed, AK|D'Onofrio, BM|Ganiban, JM|Lichtenstein, P|Narusyte, J|Neiderhiser, JM|Reiss, D|Spotts, EL","Andershed, Anna-Karin|D'Onofrio, Brian M.|Ganiban, Jody M.|Lichtenstein, Paul|Narusyte, Jurgita|Neiderhiser, Jenae M.|Reiss, David|Spotts, Erica L.",365,-1,,,,,,,-1,,-1,,,,,,,,Article,10.1037/a0021815,,,,376,Clarivate Analytics Web of Science,,,,,,0021-843X,2,,,JOURNAL OF ABNORMAL PSYCHOLOGY,,,,MONOZYGOTIC-TWIN DIFFERENCES|ANTISOCIAL-BEHAVIOR|CHILD RELATIONSHIPS|EXPRESSED EMOTION|DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS|FAMILY ENVIRONMENT|TESTING HYPOTHESES|MIDDLE CHILDHOOD|SWEDISH TWIN|MODEL,-1,"Andershed, Anna-Karin/0000-0003-3981-0353; lichtenstein, paul/0000-0003-3037-5287",parenting|externalizing behavior|twins|genotype-environment correlation,,MAY,J,2011,,,,,,"Psychology, Clinical|Psychiatry",,-1,,Psychology; Psychiatry,,30,Parental Criticism and Externalizing Behavior Problems in Adolescents: The Role of Environment and Genotype-Environment Correlation,30,,WOS:000290595900009,1,120,,21280930,C:\Users\mginda\Desktop\agc1\wos-extract.isi,"Narusyte J, 2011, V120, P365, DOI 10.1037/a0021815"
"Purpose: Women lag behind men in several key academic indicators, such as advancement, retention, and securing leadership positions. Although reasons for these disparities are multifactorial, policies that do not support work-life integration contribute to the problem. The objective of this descriptive study was to compare the faculty work-life policies among medical schools in the Big Ten conference. Methods: Each institution's website was accessed in order to assess its work-life policies in the following areas: maternity leave, paternity leave, adoption leave, extension of probationary period, part-time appointments, part-time benefits (specifically health insurance), child care options, and lactation policy. Institutions were sent requests to validate the online data and supply additional information if needed. Results: Each institution received an overall score and subscale scores for family leave policies and part-time issues. Data were verified by the human resources office at 8 of the 10 schools. Work-life policies varied among Big Ten schools, with total scores between 9.25 and 13.5 (possible score: 0-21; higher scores indicate greater flexibility). Subscores were not consistently high or low within schools. Conclusions: Comparing the flexibility of faculty work-life policies in relation to other schools will help raise awareness of these issues and promote more progressive policies among less progressive schools. Ultimately, flexible policies will lead to greater equity and institutional cultures that are conducive to recruiting, retaining, and advancing diverse faculty.",,"Wiehe, Sarah/R-6083-2017","Dankoski, ME|Palmer-Smith, V|Welch, JL|Wiehe, SE","Dankoski, Mary E.|Palmer-Smith, Victoria|Welch, Julie L.|Wiehe, Sarah E.",725,-1,,,,,,,-1,,-1,,,,,,,,Article,10.1089/jwh.2010.2553,,,,732,Clarivate Analytics Web of Science,,,,,,1540-9996,5,,,JOURNAL OF WOMENS HEALTH,,,,WOMEN|GENDER|GAP,-1,"Wiehe, Sarah/0000-0002-8148-0848",,,MAY,J,2011,,,,,,"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health|Medicine, General & Internal|Obstetrics & Gynecology|Women's Studies",,-1,,"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health; General & Internal Medicine; Obstetrics & Gynecology; Women's Studies",,9,Flexibility in Faculty Work-Life Policies at Medical Schools in the Big Ten Conference,9,,WOS:000290785800012,1,20,,21501084,C:\Users\mginda\Desktop\agc1\wos-extract.isi,"Welch JL, 2011, V20, P725, DOI 10.1089/jwh.2010.2553"
"Research has documented associations between family functioning and offspring psychosocial adjustment, but questions remain regarding whether these associations are partly due to confounding genetic factors and other environmental factors. The current study used a genetically informed approach, the Children of Twins design, to explore the associations between family functioning (family conflict, marital quality, and agreement about parenting) and offspring psychopathology. Participants were 867 twin pairs (388 monozygotic; 479 dizygotic) from the Twin and Offspring Study in Sweden, their spouses, and children (51.7% female; M = 15.75 years). The results suggested associations between exposure to family conflict (assessed by the mother, father, and child) and child adjustment were independent of genetic factors and other environmental factors. However, when family conflict was assessed using only children's reports, the results indicated that genetic factors also influenced these associations. In addition, the analyses indicated that exposure to low marital quality and agreement about parenting was associated with children's internalizing and externalizing problems and that genetic factors also contributed to the associations of marital quality and agreement about parenting with offspring externalizing problems.",,,"D'Onofrio, BM|Ganiban, JM|Lichtenstein, P|Neiderhiser, JM|Reiss, D|Schermerhorn, AC|Spotts, EL|Turkheimer, E","D'Onofrio, Brian M.|Ganiban, Jody M.|Lichtenstein, Paul|Neiderhiser, Jenae M.|Reiss, David|Schermerhorn, Alice C.|Spotts, Erica L.|Turkheimer, Eric",707,-1,,,,,,,-1,,-1,,,,,,,,Article,10.1037/a0021362,,,,725,Clarivate Analytics Web of Science,,,,,,0012-1649,3,,,DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY,,,,GENOTYPE-ENVIRONMENT CORRELATION|MARITAL CONFLICT|ANTISOCIAL-BEHAVIOR|PARENTAL DIVORCE|OFFSPRING PSYCHOPATHOLOGY|ADOLESCENT PERCEPTIONS|EXTERNALIZING BEHAVIOR|EMOTIONAL SECURITY|MUTUAL INFLUENCE|TWINS DESIGN,-1,"lichtenstein, paul/0000-0003-3037-5287",family relations|child adjustment|genetics|offspring|twins,,MAY,J,2011,,,,,,"Psychology, Developmental",,-1,,Psychology,,13,A Genetically Informed Study of Associations Between Family Functioning and Child Psychosocial Adjustment,15,,WOS:000290083500008,1,47,,21142367,C:\Users\mginda\Desktop\agc1\wos-extract.isi,"Schermerhorn AC, 2011, V47, P707, DOI 10.1037/a0021362"

Using structural equation modeling to assess survey data from 204 high school football players, results demonstrated that moral atmosphere (i.e., the influence of coaches and teammates) was significantly associated with participants' process of on-field moral functioning across the levels of judgment, intention, and behavior. Neither masculine gender role conflict nor athletic identity significantly predicted moral functioning, but the results indicated that participants' identification with the athlete role significantly predicted conflict with socialized gender roles. Results suggest that in the aggressive and violent sport of football, coaches can have a direct influence on players' moral functioning process.

"Objective: To identify the impact of timing of prenatal stress exposure on offspring risk for shortened gestational age, preterm birth (PTB), low birth weight (LBW), and small for gestational age (SGA), using a population-based sample. Methods: Swedish longitudinal population registries were linked to study all individuals born in Sweden from 1973 to 2004. Prenatal maternal stress exposure was defined as death of the father of the child or first-degree relative of the mother. Using linear and logistic regression, timing of stress exposure was examined across pregnancy, by month, and by novel periods created based on month of stress exposure findings. Results: A total of 2,618,777 live-born, singleton infants without congenital anomalies were included; 32,286 were exposed to prenatal maternal stress. Examining associations between stress exposure and outcome by the month revealed that risk increases midgestation, particularly after months 5 and 6. Combining months 1 to 4, 5 and 6, and 7 to 9 as potential periods of differing vulnerability, it was found that stress during period 2 (months 5 and 6) was associated with the greatest risk for shortened gestational age (-0.52 days, standard error = 0.15, p = .0006), PTB (odds ratio [OR], 1.24; 99% confidence interval [CI], 1.08-1.42), LBW (OR, 1.38; 99% CI, 1.19-1.61), and SGA (OR, 1.25; 99% CI, 1.05-1.49). Conclusions: Risk for shortened GA, PTB, LBW, and SGA are greater post stress exposure during the 5th and/or 6th month of pregnancy. It may be beneficial to refine future analyses to these months. Possible mechanisms include alterations in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and associated stress-responsive molecular regulators.",,,"Class, QA|D'Onofrio, BM|Langstorm, N|Lichtenstein, P","Class, Quetzal A.|D'Onofrio, Brian M.|Langstorm, Niklas|Lichtenstein, Paul",234,-1,,,,,,,-1,,-1,,,,,,,,Article,10.1097/PSY.0b013e31820a62ce,,,,241,Clarivate Analytics Web of Science,,,,,,0033-3174,3,,,PSYCHOSOMATIC MEDICINE,,,,LOW-BIRTH-WEIGHT|11-BETA-HYDROXYSTEROID DEHYDROGENASE TYPE-2|INTRAUTERINE GROWTH RESTRICTION|COMPLETE FOLLOW-UP|PRETERM BIRTH|PLACENTAL CLOCK|GESTATIONAL-AGE|HORMONE-LEVELS|STRESS|COHORT,-1,"lichtenstein, paul/0000-0003-3037-5287",stress|pregnancy|timing|preterm birth|low birth weight|small for gestational age,,APR,J,2011,,,,,,"Psychiatry|Psychology|Psychology, Multidisciplinary",,-1,,Psychiatry; Psychology,,80,Timing of Prenatal Maternal Exposure to Severe Life Events and Adverse Pregnancy Outcomes: A Population Study of 2.6 Million Pregnancies,82,,WOS:000289740900003,1,73,,21321257,C:\Users\mginda\Desktop\agc1\wos-extract.isi,"Class QA, 2011, V73, P234, DOI 10.1097/PSY.0b013e31820a62ce"

"Adolescence is a highly conserved period during which mammals undergo a number of hormonal, biological, and behavioral changes [Spear [2000] Neurosci. Biobehav. Rev. 24: 417-463]. Ethical constraints limit the research that can be done in human adolescents. Rodents provide a useful model of at least some of the features of adolescence, including increases in body growth, differences in sleep/wake, and eating patterns, as well as differences in risk-taking, novelty seeking, and exploratory behaviors. Much of the available developmental research has utilized rats; however, the use of inbred mouse strains provides a unique means to assess the genetic factors involved in behavioral differences during adolescence. We assessed differences between adults and adolescents in anxiety-like, locomotor, and consummatory behaviors using two commonly used inbred strains of mice, the DBA/2J and C57BL/6J strains. Age and genotype-dependent differences were found in all three behaviors measured, suggesting both factors are important determinants of behavior in mice. (C) 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Participants were 8-17 years old (N = 3,658; 66% African-American) and logistic regression models were conducted. For pre-teen females, decreased friend monitoring was related to high problem behavior; for teen females, lower maternal support and decreased home monitoring were significant.

"OBJECTIVE: We assessed differences in chlamydia screening rates according to race/ethnicity, insurance status, age, and previous sexually transmitted infection (STI) or pregnancy. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was performed using electronic medical record and billing data for women 14 to 25 years of age in 2002-2007, assessing differences in the odds of a chlamydia test being performed at that visit. RESULTS: Adjusted odds of a chlamydia test being performed were lower among women 14 to 15 years of age (odds ratio: 0.83 [95% confidence interval: 0.70-1.00]) and 20 to 25 years of age (20-21 years, odds ratio: 0.78 [95% confidence interval: 0.70-0.89]; 22-23 years, odds ratio: 0.76 [95% confidence interval: 0.67-0.87]; 24-25 years, odds ratio: 0.64 [95% confidence interval: 0.57-0.73]), compared with women 18 to 19 years of age. Black women had 3 times increased odds (odds ratio: 2.96 [95% confidence interval: 2.66-3.28]) and Hispanic women nearly 13 times increased odds (odds ratio: 12.89 [95% confidence interval: 10.85-15.30]) of testing, compared with white women. Women with public (odds ratio: 1.74 [95% confidence interval: 1.58-1.91]) and public pending (odds ratio: 6.85 [95% confidence interval: 5.13-9.15]) insurance had increased odds of testing, compared with women with private insurance. After first STI diagnosis, differences according to race/ethnicity persisted but were smaller; after first pregnancy, differences persisted. CONCLUSIONS: Despite recommendations to screen all sexually active young women for chlamydia, providers screened women differently according to age, race/ethnicity, and insurance status, although differences were reduced after first STI or pregnancy.

Gangestad (Chap. 9) provides an important introduction to the field of evolutionary psychology and presents an overview of how the discipline approaches the study of familial processes. Here, we documents the ways in which three broad research perspectives and methods have been influenced by and can influence evolutionary psychology: (a) social neuroscience research on mate selection, (b) quasi-experimental studies that test causal inferences concerning social influences, and (c) quantitative behavior genetic research that examines whether the heritability of traits has varied across historical context.",,,"D'Onofrio, BM|Langstorm, N|Lichtenstein, P","D'Onofrio, Brian M.|Langstorm, Niklas|Lichtenstein, Paul",149,-1,,,,,,National Symposium on Family Issues,-1,,-1,,,"OCT 08-09, 2009",Penn State Univ,"Penn State Univ, Univ Park Campus, PA",,17th Annual Penn State Symposium on Family Issues,Proceedings Paper,10.1007/978-1-4419-7361-0_10,,"Booth, A McHale, SM Landale, NS",,+,Clarivate Analytics Web of Science,,,,978-1-4419-7360-3,,2192-9157,,,,BIOSOCIAL FOUNDATIONS OF FAMILY PROCESSES,,,,ENVIRONMENT INTERACTION|SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE|BEHAVIOR|VARIANCE|GENETICS|PROGRESS|MODELS,-1,,,,,S,2011,,,,,,Family Studies,,-1,,Family Studies,,0,The Need for Family Research Using Multiple Approaches and Methods,0,,WOS:000293099400010,1,,,,C:\Users\mginda\Desktop\agc1\wos-extract.isi,"D'Onofrio BM, 2011, P149, DOI 10.1007/978-1-4419-7361-0_10"

Previous research has shown that disfluency - the subjective experience of difficulty associated with cognitive operations - leads to deeper processing. Two studies explore the extent to which this deeper processing engendered by disfluency interventions can lead to improved memory performance. Study 1 found that information in hard-to-read fonts was better remembered than easier to read information in a controlled laboratory setting. Study 2 extended this finding to high school classrooms. The results suggest that superficial changes to learning materials could yield significant improvements in educational outcomes. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

"Background In utero exposure to tobacco smoking has been suggested to cause persistent alterations in cognitive functioning. We examined if mothers' smoking during pregnancy (SDP) is associated with long-term impairment in offspring stress coping and the causal mechanism behind a possible link. Methods We used a large cohort (n = 187 106) of young males in Sweden (mean age = 18.2 years), who underwent a semi-structured psychological assessment in 1997-2006, including an evaluation of stress coping ability, as part of the compulsory military conscript examination. We compared differentially exposed siblings within nuclear families and cousins in extended families and used multilevel structural equation models to disentangle genetic from environmental contributions to the association between SDP and stress coping. Results SDP and offspring stress coping was moderately strongly associated when comparing unrelated individuals [regression coefficient (b) = -0.38 on a nine-point scale; 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.40 to -0.36, P < 0.0001]. In contrast, it disappeared when siblings were compared (b = 0.11; 95% CI -0.01 to 0.23, P = 0.071). This familial confounding was entirely due to genetic influences. Conclusions SDP is an established risk factor for pregnancy- and birth-related complications. However, we found no long-term effect of SDP on offspring stress coping. Rather, the observed association was due to familial confounding of genetic origin; women prone to SDP also transmit genes to their children that are associated with poorer coping with stress.",,"Langstrom, Niklas/C-5615-2009","D'Onofrio, BM|Iliadou, AN|Kuja-Halkola, R|Langstorm, N|Lichtenstein, P","D'Onofrio, Brian M.|Iliadou, Anastasia N.|Kuja-Halkola, Ralf|Langstorm, Niklas|Lichtenstein, Paul",1531,-1,,,,,,,-1,,-1,,,,,,,,Article,10.1093/ije/dyq133,,,,1540,Clarivate Analytics Web of Science,,,,,,0300-5771,6,,,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY,,,,FOR-GESTATIONAL-AGE|MATERNAL SMOKING|CIGARETTE-SMOKING|CHILD OUTCOMES|FETAL-GROWTH|INFANT-DEATH|PREGNANCY|ASSOCIATION|PERFORMANCE|NICOTINE,-1,"lichtenstein, paul/0000-0003-3037-5287; Kuja-Halkola, Ralf/0000-0002-3765-2067",Smoking during pregnancy|adolescent stress coping|children-of-sibling model|intergenerational association,,DEC,J,2010,,,,,,"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health",,-1,,"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health",,18,Prenatal smoking exposure and offspring stress coping in late adolescence: no causal link,18,,WOS:000284952700021,1,39,1464-3685,20719746,C:\Users\mginda\Desktop\agc1\wos-extract.isi,"Kuja-Halkola R, 2010, V39, P1531, DOI 10.1093/ije/dyq133"
"Purpose: Examine the effects of the timing of parents' relationship instability on adolescent sexual and mental health. Methods: We assessed whether the timing of parents' relationship instability predicted adolescents' history of sexual partnerships (SP) and major depressive episodes. Multivariate logistic regression analyses controlled for potential mediators related to parenting and the family, including parent knowledge of activities, parent-child relationship quality, number of parents' post-separation relationship transitions, and number of available caregivers. Participants were assessed annually from age 5 through young adulthood as part of a multisite community sample (N=585). Results: Participants who experienced parents' relationship instability before age 5 were more likely to report SP at age 16 (odds ratio [OR](adj)=1.58) or an episode of major depression during adolescence (OR(adj)=2.61). Greater parent knowledge at age 12 decreased the odds of SP at age 16, but none of the hypothesized parenting and family variables statistically mediated the association between early instability and SP or major depressive episode. Conclusions: These results suggest that experiencing parents' relationship instability in early childhood is associated with sexual behavior and major depression in adolescence, but these associations are not explained by the parenting and family variables included in our analyses. Limitations of the current study and implications for future research are discussed. (C) 2010 Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine.

"Background: Diagnostic chlamydia testing is recommended for all young women demonstrating sexually transmitted infection (STI) symptoms. Differential testing among symptomatic women may contribute to disparities in chlamydia rates. Our objective was to determine whether providers test young women with STI symptoms for chlamydia differently by age, race/ethnicity, or insurance status, and whether testing patterns differ by documentation of previous STI. Methods: Retrospective cohort analysis using electronic medical records and billing data of women 14 to 25 years old with one or more diagnostic or procedure codes indicative of STI symptoms (N = 61,498 women). Random effects logistic regression analysis was performed to assess the odds of chlamydia testing given a woman presented for a nonpregnancy-related visit with STI symptoms. All analyses controlled for history of STI, setting, and year, and adjusted for within-person correlation. Results: A chlamydia test was performed in 38% of visits with codes indicating STI symptoms. Women aged <18 or >19 were less likely to be tested than women aged 18 to 19, with young women aged 14 to 15 having the lowest odds of being tested (Odd Ratio [OR]: 0.52). Providers were more likely to test minority (OR(black): 2.87; OR(Latina): 2.10) compared with white women. Women were also more likely to be 2.35) compared with if they had private insurance. Women aged 14 to 15 and 16 to 17 with prior history of STI had increased odds of chlamydia testing (OR: 1.79 and 1.43, respectively) compared with women aged 18 to 19, changing the overall direction of association compared with women with no history of STI. The odds of testing were dramatically reduced for minority and nonprivately insured young women with history of STI, although significant differences persisted. Conclusions: Provider chlamydia testing differs by age, race/ethnicity, and insurance status when a woman presents with STI symptoms and no prior history of STI. This bias may contribute to higher reported rates of chlamydia among younger, minority, and poor women.",,"Wiehe, Sarah/R-6083-2017","Fortenberry, JD|Rosenman, MB|Wang, JN|Wiehe, SE","Fortenberry, J.

Randomized experiments provide the strongest tests of causal hypotheses but are not always feasible, and their assumptions cannot always be met. In such cases, a number of quasi-experimental research designs can be used to substantially reduce confounding in tests of causal hypotheses. Sibling-comparison designs provide robust quasi-experimental tests of causal environmental hypotheses, but they are underused in psychology in spite of their power, feasibility, and convenience.",,,"D'Onofrio, BM|Lahey, BB","D'Onofrio, Brian M.|Lahey, Benjamin B.",319,-1,,,,,,,-1,,-1,,,,,,,,Article,10.1177/0963721410383977,,,,323,Clarivate Analytics Web of Science,,,,,,0963-7214,5,,,CURRENT DIRECTIONS IN PSYCHOLOGICAL SCIENCE,,,,EXTERNALIZING PROBLEMS|MATERNAL SMOKING|CHILD OUTCOMES|PREGNANCY|INFERENCE|SWEDEN,-1,,sibling comparisons|environmental influences|causal models|quasi-experiments,,OCT,J,2010,,,,,,"Psychology, Multidisciplinary",,-1,,Psychology,,102,All in the Family: Comparing Siblings to Test Causal Hypotheses Regarding Environmental Influences on Behavior,102,,WOS:000288425800009,1,19,,23645975,C:\Users\mginda\Desktop\agc1\wos-extract.isi,"Lahey BB, 2010, V19, P319, DOI 10.1177/0963721410383977"
"Background: Home-based voluntary counseling and testing (HCT) presents a novel approach to early diagnosis. We sought to describe uptake of pediatric HIV testing, associated factors, and HIV prevalence among children offered HCT in Kenya. Methods: The USAID-Academic Model Providing Access to Healthcare Partnership conducted HCT in western Kenya in 2008. Children 18 months to 13 years were offered HCT if their mother was known to be dead, her living status was unknown, mother was HIV infected, or of unknown HIV status. This retrospective analysis describes the cohort of children encountered and tested. Results: HCT was offered to 2289 children and accepted for 1294 (57%). Children were more likely to be tested if more information was available about a suspected or confirmed maternal HIV infection [for HIV-infected living mothers odds ratio (OR) = 3.20, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.64 to 6.23), if parents were not in household (OR = 1.50, 95% CI: 1.40 to 1.63), if they were grandchildren of head of household (OR = 4.02, 95% CI: 3.06 to 5.28), or if their father was not in household (OR = 1.41, 95% CI: 1.24 to 1.56). Of the eligible children tested, 60 (4.6%) were HIV infected. Conclusions: HCT provides an opportunity to identify HIV among high-risk children; however, acceptance of HCT for children was limited. Further investigation is needed to identify and overcome barriers to testing uptake.",,"Wiehe, Sarah/R-6083-2017","Ayaya, SO|Braitstein, P|Ndege, SK|Nyandiko, WM|Vreeman, RC|Were, MC|Wiehe, SE","Ayaya, Samwel O.|Braitstein, Paula|Ndege, Samson K.|Nyandiko, Winstone M.|Vreeman, Rachel C.|Were, Martin C.|Wiehe, Sarah E.",E3,-1,,,,,,,-1,,-1,,,,,,,,Article,10.1097/QAI.0b013e3181f0758f,,,,E10,Clarivate Analytics Web of Science,,,,,,1525-4135,2,,,JAIDS-JOURNAL OF ACQUIRED IMMUNE DEFICIENCY SYNDROMES,,,,EXPERIENCE|AFRICA|MALAWI,-1,"Wiehe, Sarah/0000-0002-8148-0848",barriers to testing|HIV|home-based testing|pediatrics,,1-Oct,J,2010,,,,,,Immunology|Infectious Diseases,,-1,,Immunology; Infectious Diseases,,11,"Acceptance of HIV Testing for Children Ages 18 Months to 13 Years Identified Through Voluntary, Home-Based HIV Counseling and Testing in Western Kenya",11,,WOS:000282504100001,1,55,,20714272,C:\Users\mginda\Desktop\agc1\wos-extract.isi,"Vreeman RC, 2010, V55, E3, DOI 10.1097/QAI.0b013e3181f0758f"

"The current pair of experimental studies sought to further validate the role of positive urgency (acting rashly when in an extreme positive emotional state) as a risk factor for impulsive and maladaptive behavior. Previous research has supported the use of emotion-based dispositions to rash action in predicting a wide range of maladaptive acts. However, that research was conducted in the field and relied on self-reported behavior, thus lacking tight experimental controls and direct observation of risky behaviors. In the 2 experimental studies described here, we found that among college students (1) positive urgency significantly predicted negative outcomes on a risk-taking task following a positive mood manipulation (n = 94), and (2) positive urgency significantly predicted increases in beer consumption following positive mood induction (n = 33). Positive urgency's role was above and beyond previously identified risk factors; these findings, combined with prior cross-sectional and longitudinal field studies, provide support for the role of positive urgency in rash action.",,,"Combs, JL|Cyders, MA|Fillmore, MT|Settles, RE|Smith, GT|Zapolski, TCB","Combs, Jessica L.|Cyders, Melissa A.|Fillmore, Mark T.|Settles, Regan E.|Smith, Gregoty T.|Zapolski, Tamika C.

"The past decade brought a remarkable increase in the number and quality of biosocial studies of family processes. The current review summarizes recent advances in biosocial family research by providing key exemplars of emerging research paradigms. Research in the past decade has substantiated the claim in the previous Decade Review (Booth, Carver, & Granger, 2000) that bidirectional influences between all levels of analysis are paramount. There is an emerging consensus that integrating factors at multiple biological and social levels is highly informative. Because ignoring biological factors often will underestimate mediating or moderating mechanisms, the review provides recommendations for biosocial family research. We also highlight the need for researchers who understand complex family environments to lend their expertise to biosocial studies.",,,"D'Onofrio, BM|Lahey, BB","D'Onofrio, Brian M.|Lahey, Benjamin B.",762,-1,,,,,,,-1,,-1,,,,,,,,Review,10.1111/j.1741-3737.2010.00729.x,,,,782,Clarivate Analytics Web of Science,,,,,,0022-2445,3,,,JOURNAL OF MARRIAGE AND FAMILY,,,,GENE-ENVIRONMENT INTERACTIONS|PHYSICAL MALTREATMENT|BEHAVIORAL-GENETICS|ANTISOCIAL-BEHAVIOR|SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE|CONDUCT PROBLEMS|MENTAL-HEALTH|SEX STEROIDS|LIFE-STRESS|CHILDREN,-1,,family process|family structure|marriage and close relationships|selection effects|social context|within-family design,,JUN,J,2010,,,,,,Family Studies|Sociology,,-1,,Family Studies; Sociology,,26,Biosocial Influences on the Family: A Decade Review,26,,WOS:000278914800020,1,72,,24009400,C:\Users\mginda\Desktop\agc1\wos-extract.isi,"D'Onofrio BM, 2010, V72, P762, DOI 10.1111/j.1741-3737.2010.00729.x"
"Although Web-based instruction offers an advantageous approach to medical education, few studies have addressed the use of Web-based education to teach clinical content at the postgraduate level. Even fewer studies have addressed clinical outcomes after theWeb-based instruction, yet postgraduate training requirements now focus on outcomes of training. A randomized trial was conducted to compare knowledge of postgraduate year (PGY) 1 residents after Web-based with that after paper-based instruction and to compare residents' clinical application of their instruction using unannounced standardized patients (SPs) and unannounced activated standardized patients (ASPs). PGY 1 residents were assigned to a month-long ambulatory rotation during which they were randomized as a block toWebor paper-based instruction covering the same four geriatric syndromes (dementia, depression, falls, and urinary incontinence). Outcome measures were mean change scores for before and after testing and scores from SP and ASP clinical encounter forms (checklist, chart abstraction, and electronic order entry). Residents who completed the Web-based instruction showed significantly greater improvement on the knowledge tests than those who received paper-based instruction. There were no significant differences in the scores from the SP and ASP clinical encounters except that the chart abstraction score was better for Web-based group than the paper-based group for dementia. Web-based instruction is an educational tool that medical residents readily accept and can be used to improve knowledge of core geriatrics content as measured using immediate posttesting. More-intensive educational interventions are needed to improve clinical performance by trainees in the care of older patients.

"Context: The association between maternal smoking during pregnancy (SDP) and offspring disruptive behaviors has been well documented, but it is unclear whether exposure to SDP or the effects of factors correlated with SDP account for the increased risk. Objective: To test whether the association between SDP and offspring criminal convictions was consistent with a causal connection or due to familial background factors by controlling for measured covariates and using a quasi-experimental approach. Design: We used a population-based study of children born in Sweden from 1983 to 1989 (N=609 372) to examine the association between SDP and offspring criminal convictions while controlling for measured traits of both parents. We also compared siblings differentially exposed to SDP (n=50 339) to account for unmeasured familial factors that could account for the association. Setting: Population-based study of all children born in Sweden from 1983 to 1989 with information on maternal SDP and offspring criminal convictions based on national registries collected by the Swedish government. Patients or Other Participants: Children born in Sweden from 1983 to 1989 (N=609 372) and siblings differentially exposed to SDP (n=50 339). Main Outcome Measures: Violent and nonviolent convictions, based on the Swedish National Crime Register, a register with detailed information on all convictions in the country. Results: Moderate (hazard rate [HR], 2.47; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.34-2.60) and high (HR, 3.43; 95% CI, 3.25-3.63) levels of maternal SDP were associated with an increased risk for offspring violent convictions, even when controlling for maternal and paternal traits. There was no association between SDP and violent convictions, however, when comparing differentially exposed siblings (HRmoderate, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.79-1.30; HRhigh, 1.03; 95% CI, 0.78-1.37). Smoking during pregnancy also was associated with nonviolent convictions in the entire population (HRmoderate, 1.62; 95% CI, 1.58-1.66; HRhigh, 1.87; 95% CI, 1.82-1.92) and when controlling for covariates. But, there was no association when comparing siblings who were differentially exposed (HRmoderate, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.78-1.01; HRhigh, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.78-1.02). Conclusion: The results suggest that familial background factors account for the association between maternal SDP and criminal convictions, not the specific exposure to SDP.",,"Langstrom, Niklas/C-5615-2009","D'Onofrio, BM|Grann, M|Hultman, CM|Iliadou, AN|Lambe, M|Langstorm, N|Lichtenstein, P|Neiderhiser, JM|Singh, AL","D'Onofrio, Brian M.|Grann, Martin|Hultman, Christina M.|Iliadou, Anastasia N.|Lambe, Mats|Langstorm, Niklas|Lichtenstein, Paul|Neiderhiser, Jenae M.|Singh, Amber L.",529,-1,,,,,,,-1,,-1,,,,,,,,Article,10.1001/archgenpsychiatry.2010.33,,,,538,Clarivate Analytics Web of Science,,,,,,0003-990X,5,,,ARCHIVES OF GENERAL PSYCHIATRY,,,,PRENATAL DRUG EXPOSURE|ANTISOCIAL-BEHAVIOR|MENTAL-DISORDERS|CONDUCT PROBLEMS|CHILD OUTCOMES|TWINS DESIGN|BIRTH COHORT|RISK-FACTORS|CAUSAL|PSYCHOPATHOLOGY,-1,"Lambe, Mats/0000-0002-4624-3767; lichtenstein, paul/0000-0003-3037-5287",,,MAY,J,2010,,,,,,Psychiatry,,-1,,Psychiatry,,68,Familial Confounding of the Association Between Maternal Smoking During Pregnancy and Offspring Criminality A Population-Based Study in Sweden,68,,WOS:000277261200011,1,67,1538-3636,20439834,C:\Users\mginda\Desktop\agc1\wos-extract.isi,"D'Onofrio BM, 2010, V67, P529, DOI 10.1001/archgenpsychiatry.2010.33"
"Repeated exposure to ethanol may produce increased sensitivity to its acute locomotor stimulant actions, a process referred to as locomotor sensitization. Neuroadaptation within certain brain circuits, including those possessing GABA(A) receptors, may underlie locomotor sensitization to ethanol. Indeed, GABA(A) receptors are documented mediators of ethanol's cellular and behavioral actions. Moreover, because subunit composition of this receptor is predictive of its pharmacology, it is possible that alterations in subunit composition contribute to the expression of locomotor sensitization to ethanol. The goal of the present study was to determine if alterations in GABA(A) subunit composition are associated with the expression of locomotor sensitization in DBA/2J mice, a strain known to be particularly susceptible to the development of this behavioral phenomenon. Following a modified 14 day sensitization procedure (Phillips et al., 1994) relative changes in GABA(A) subunit gene expression were assessed in discrete mesolimbic brain regions. To determine if the observed changes in gene expression produced functional changes in the locomotor responses to drugs known to either preferentially or generally activate GABA(A) receptors normally possessing the significantly altered subunits, separate cohorts of animals were challenged with one of several low doses of zolpidem (alpha 1-selective), etomidate (beta 2/3-selective), or flurazepam (gamma 2-directed) and assessed for locomotor alterations. Sensitized animals displayed increased expression of the alpha 1, beta 2, and gamma 2 (v1) subunits in the Nucleus Accumbens (NAc) but not Ventral Tegmental Area (VTA). Additionally, sensitized animals displayed altered sensitivity to the locomotor actions of etomidate and flurazepam. These results support the hypothesis that neuroadaptive changes in GABA(A) subunit composition participate in the expression of locomotor sensitization. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

"Background: Alcohol use is common during the adolescent period, a time at which a number of crucial neurobiological, hormonal, and behavioral changes occur (Spear, 2000). In order to more fully understand the complex interaction between alcohol use and these age-typical neurobiological changes, animal models must be utilized. Rodents experience a developmental period similar to that of adolescence. Although rat models have shown striking adolescent-specific differences in sensitivity to ethanol, little work has been done in mice despite the fact that the C57BL/6J (B6) and DBA2/J (D2) mice have been shown to markedly differ in ethanol preference drinking and exhibit widely different sensitivities to ethanol. Methods: The current study examined ethanol intake in adolescent and adult B6 and D2 mice using a limited access alcohol exposure paradigm called Drinking in the Dark (DID). Additionally, the effect of adolescent (or adult) ethanol exposure on subsequent adult ethanol intake was examined by re-exposing the mice to the same paradigm once the adolescents reached adulthood. We hypothesized that adolescent (P25-45) mice would exhibit greater binge-like alcohol intake compared to adults (P60-80), and that B6 mice would exhibit greater binge-like alcohol intake compared to D2 mice. Moreover, we predicted that relative difference in binge-like alcohol intake between adolescents and adults would be greater in D2 mice. Results: Adolescent B6 mice consumed more ethanol than adults in the DID model. There was no difference between adolescent and adult D2 mice. Conclusions: This work adds to the literature suggesting that adolescents will consume more ethanol than adults and that this exposure can result in altered adult intake. However, this effect seems largely dependent upon genotype. Future work will continue to examine age-related differences in ethanol intake, preference, and sensitivity in inbred mouse strains.",,"Melon, Laverne/B-8208-2013","Boehm, SL|Linsenbardt, DN|Mariani, JN|Melon, LC|Moore, EM","Boehm, Stephen L., II|Linsenbardt, David N.|Mariani, John N.|Melon, Laverne C.|Moore, Eileen M.",734,-1,,,,,,,-1,,-1,,,,,,,,Article,10.1111/j.1530-0277.2009.01143.x,,,,742,Clarivate Analytics Web of Science,,,,,,0145-6008,4,,,ALCOHOLISM-CLINICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL RESEARCH,,,,INDUCED HYPOTHERMIA|SOCIAL-BEHAVIOR|INBRED MICE|RATS|ONTOGENY|ALCOHOL|TOLERANCE|AGE|SENSITIZATION|DETERMINANTS,-1,"Melon, Laverne/0000-0002-2256-3707",Adolescent|Mice|Ethanol|Drinking in the Dark|Development,,APR,J,2010,,,,,,Substance Abuse,,-1,,Substance Abuse,,39,Adolescent C57BL/6J (but not DBA/2J) Mice Consume Greater Amounts of Limited-Access Ethanol Compared to Adults and Display Continued Elevated Ethanol Intake into Adulthood,39,,WOS:000275916900018,1,34,,20102570,C:\Users\mginda\Desktop\agc1\wos-extract.isi,"Moore EM, 2010, V34, P734, DOI 10.1111/j.1530-0277.2009.01143.x"
"Objectives. We examined associations between perceived racial/ethnic discrimination, gender, and cigarette smoking among adolescents. Methods. We examined data on Black and Latino adolescents aged 12 to 19 years who participated in the Moving to Opportunity study (N=2561). Perceived discrimination was assessed using survey items asking about unfair treatment because of race/ethnicity in the prior 6 months. We used logistic regression to investigate associations between discrimination and smoking, stratified by gender and controlling for covariates. Results. One fourth of adolescents reported that discrimination had occurred in at least 1 location. Discrimination was associated with increased odds of smoking among boys (odds ratio [OR]=1.9; 95% confidence interval [CI]=1.2, 3.0) and decreased odds among girls (OR=0.6; 95% CI=0.3, 1.1). Discrimination at school or work contributed to associations for girls (OR=0.3; 95% CI=0.1, 0.9), and discrimination at shops (OR=2.0; 95% Cl=1.1, 3.8) and by police (OR=2.0; 95% CI=11.2, 3.4) contributed to associations for boys. Conclusions. Associations between discrimination and smoking differ by gender. Girls' decreased smoking in higher-discrimination settings may be a result of protective factors associated with where they spend time. Boys' increased smoking in higher-discrimination settings may reflect increased stress from gender-specific targeting by police and businesses.

"Objective: Rigorous human-computer interaction (HCI) design methodologies have not traditionally been applied to the development of clinical trial participant tracking (CTPT) tools. Given the frequent use of iconic HCI models in CTPTs, and prior evidence of usability problems associated with the use of ambiguous icons in complex interfaces, such approaches may be problematic. Presentation Discovery (PD), a knowledge-anchored HCI design method, has been previously demonstrated to improve the design of iconic HCI models. In this study, we compare the usability of a CTPT HCI model designed using PD and an intuitively designed CTPT HCI model. Methods: An iconic CPTP HCI model was created using PD. The PD-generated and an existing iconic CTPT HCI model were subjected to usability testing, with an emphasis on task accuracy and completion times. Study participants also completed a qualitative survey instrument to evaluate subjective satisfaction with the two models. Results: CTPT end-users reliably and reproducibly agreed on the visual manifestation and semantics of prototype graphics generated using PD. The performance of the PD-generated iconic HCI model was equivalent to an existing HCI model for tasks at multiple levels of complexity, and in some cases superior. This difference was particularly notable when tasks required an understanding of the semantic meanings of multiple icons. Conclusion: The use of PD to design an iconic CTPT HCI model generated beneficial results and improved end-user subjective satisfaction, while reducing task completion time. Such results are desirable in information and time intensive domains, such as clinical trials management.",,"Embi, Peter/E-3030-2011; Mendonca, Eneida/J-8895-2016","Embi, PJ|Johnson, SB|Mendonca, E|Payne, PRO|Starren, J","Embi, Peter J.|Johnson, Stephen B.|Mendonca, E.|Payne, Philip R.

"The current study, based on all births in Sweden from 1983 to 1991 (N = 654,707), explored the processes underlying the association between smoking during pregnancy (SDP) and offspring school grades and mathematic proficiency at age 15. The analyses compared relatives who varied in their exposure to SDP and who varied in their genetic relatedness. Although SDP was statistically associated with academic achievement (AA) when comparing unrelated individuals, the results suggest that SDP does not cause poorer academic performance, as full siblings differentially exposed to SDP did not differ in their academic scores. The pattern of results suggests that genetic factors shared by parents and their offspring help explain why offspring exposed to SDP have lower levels of AA.",,"Langstrom, Niklas/C-5615-2009","D'Onofrio, BM|Hultman, CM|Iliadou, AN|Lambe, M|Langstorm, N|Lichtenstein, P|Neiderhiser, JM|Singh, AL","D'Onofrio, Brian M.|Hultman, Christina M.|Iliadou, Anastasia N.|Lambe, Mats|Langstorm, Niklas|Lichtenstein, Paul|Neiderhiser, Jenae M.|Singh, Amber L.",80,-1,,,,,,,-1,,-1,,,,,,,,Article,10.1111/j.1467-8624.2009.01382.x,,,,100,Clarivate Analytics Web of Science,,,,,,0009-3920,1,,,CHILD DEVELOPMENT,,,,ANTISOCIAL-BEHAVIOR|EXTERNALIZING PROBLEMS|PRENATAL SMOKING|CHILD|OUTCOMES|TWINS|PSYCHOPATHOLOGY|ASSOCIATION|HYPOTHESES|EXPOSURE,-1,"Lambe, Mats/0000-0002-4624-3767; lichtenstein, paul/0000-0003-3037-5287",,,JAN-FEB,J,2010,,,,,,"Psychology, Educational|Psychology, Developmental",,-1,,Psychology,,51,A Quasi-Experimental Study of Maternal Smoking During Pregnancy and Offspring Academic Achievement,51,,WOS:000274308300005,1,81,,20331655,C:\Users\mginda\Desktop\agc1\wos-extract.isi,"D'Onofrio BM, 2010, V81, P80, DOI 10.1111/j.1467-8624.2009.01382.x"

"Research has shown that disfluency - the metacognitive experience of difficulty associated with a cognitive task engenders deeper processing. Since deeper processing typically leads to better retention, this paper examined whether decreasing perceptual fluency of educational materials would improve retention. Study 1 found that harder to read fonts led to increased retention in a controlled laboratory setting. Study 2 extended this finding to real-world classroom environments. It appears as though perceptual disfluency can function as a desirable difficulty in education.

"Purpose: Youth in the juvenile justice system have increased sexual risk behavior and sexually transmitted infections (STI). However, research exploring the effect of self-reported delinquency on sexual risk behavior and STI is limited, and results vary depending on the populations studied. Therefore, we used nationally representative data to examine the longitudinal association between delinquent behavior, sexual risk behavior, and STI among adolescents and young adults. Methods: We used a sample of 10,828 participants from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent and Health. Outcomes included STI and sexual risk behavior from Wave III (17-27-year-olds). Predictors for the generalized linear regression models (stratified by gender) include race, age, education, relationship status at Wave III, and delinquent behavior groups (life-course persistent, adolescence- limited, late-onset and nondelinquency). Results: None of the delinquency groups were associated with young adult STI. Only life-course persistent delinquency was associated consistently with sexual risk behavior (except for condom use). The adolescence-limited and late-onset groups had limited effects on sexual risk outcomes. Conclusions: Life-course persistent delinquency influences the expression of young adult sexual risk behavior. However, delinquent behavior does not predict STI in a population-based sample of youth. Programs and interventions that address the sexual health of youth need to consider the role of delinquency in shaping sexual risk behaviors, and future research should explore broader societal and environmental risk factors on STIs.

"Research supports that office referral data is useful in informing programmatic decisions and planning interventions such as Positive Behavior Supports (PBS). Knowledge of patterns of office referrals may facilitate development of interventions that target specific groups. This study examines patterns in office referrals within an urban district by gender, race/ ethnicity and grade. Findings reveal that there are differences by grade that appear to be related to developmental level, with more referrals for aggression in younger students (grades K-6), disrespectful behavior in middle school students (grades 7-8), and attendance problems in high school students. Gender differences in the rate and type of referrals were found, with significantly more referrals for boys' delinquent/aggressive behavior, which may relate to how schools define unacceptable behavior and the data collection method. Finally, there were significantly more referrals for African American/black students than Hispanic students, suggesting that schools consider racial differences when developing behavioral expectations.",,,"Bernard, SN|Di Donato, J|Hernandez-Brereton, M|Jaser, SS|Kaufman, JS|Reynolds, JS|Vaughan, EL","Bernard, Stanley N.|Di Donato, John|Hernandez-Brereton, Maria|Jaser, Sarah S.|Kaufman, Joy S.|Reynolds, Jesse S.|Vaughan, Ellen L.",44,-1,,,,,,,-1,,-1,,,,,,,,Article,10.1177/1098300708329710,,,,54,Clarivate Analytics Web of Science,,,,,,1098-3007,1,,,JOURNAL OF POSITIVE BEHAVIOR INTERVENTIONS,,,,POSITIVE BEHAVIOR SUPPORTS|DISCIPLINE REFERRALS|DECISION-MAKING|AGGRESSION|ELEMENTARY|VALIDITY|STUDENTS|SCHOOLS,-1,,office referral data|positive behavioral supports|schools,,JAN,J,2010,,,,,,"Psychology, Clinical|Education, Special",,-1,,Psychology; Education & Educational Research,,35,"Patterns in Office Referral Data by Grade, Race/Ethnicity, and Gender",35,,WOS:000273035800007,1,12,,25580076,C:\Users\mginda\Desktop\agc1\wos-extract.isi,"Kaufman JS, 2010, V12, P44, DOI 10.1177/1098300708329710"

Paediatric and Perinatal Epidemiology 2010; 24: 79-87. Smoking during pregnancy has been linked to an increased risk of several adverse birth outcomes. Associations with deficits in cognitive development have also been suggested. It is unclear whether these associations are due to genetic and/or environmental confounding. In a population-based Swedish cohort study on 205 777 singleton males born to Nordic mothers between 1983 and 1988, we examined the association between maternal smoking during pregnancy and the risk of poor intellectual performance in young adult male offspring. In the cohort analyses, the risk of poor intellectual performance was increased in sons of smoking mothers compared with sons of non-smokers. Stratifying for maternal smoking habits across two pregnancies, there was an increased risk of poor intellectual performance for both sons if the mother was only smoking in the first pregnancy, but in neither son if the mother was only smoking in the second pregnancy. The effect of smoking during pregnancy on intellectual performance was not present when the association was evaluated within sibling pairs. Thus, the association between prenatal smoking exposure and offspring risk of low intellectual performance appears to be completely confounded by familial (genetic and early environmental) factors.",,,"Altman, D|Cnattingius, S|D'Onofrio, BM|Hultman, CM|Iliadou, AN|Lambe, M|Lundberg, F","Altman, Daniel|Cnattingius, Sven|D'Onofrio, Brian M.|Hultman, Christina M.|Iliadou, Anastasia N.|Lambe, Mats|Lundberg, Frida",79,-1,,,,,,,-1,,-1,,,,,,,,Article,10.1111/j.1365-3016.2009.01073.x,,,,87,Clarivate Analytics Web of Science,,,,,,0269-5022,1,,,PAEDIATRIC AND PERINATAL EPIDEMIOLOGY,,,,FOR-GESTATIONAL-AGE|BIRTH-ORDER|INTELLIGENCE|OUTCOMES|EPIDEMIOLOGY|CHILDREN,-1,"Lambe, Mats/0000-0002-4624-3767; Lundberg, Frida/0000-0001-7061-7178",maternal prenatal smoking|adult IQ|siblings|confounding,,JAN,J,2010,,,,,,"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health|Obstetrics & Gynecology|Pediatrics",,-1,,"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health; Obstetrics & Gynecology; Pediatrics",,37,Maternal smoking during pregnancy and intellectual performance in young adult Swedish male offspring,37,,WOS:000273180300010,1,24,,20078833,C:\Users\mginda\Desktop\agc1\wos-extract.isi,"Lundberg F, 2010, V24, P79, DOI 10.1111/j.1365-3016.2009.01073.x"
"Background: In the USA, the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine is currently licensed for 9-26-year-old females, but licensure for women over 26 years is being considered. The aim of the current study was to investigate the association of sociodemographic and health-related factors to HPV vaccine acceptability among adult women. Methods: The current study utilised a nationally representative sample of women (n = 1323) aged 27-55 living in the USA, with an oversampling of black and Latina women. A multiple item measure of HPV vaccine acceptability across varying cost and location-of-availability (clinic only v. any local pharmacy) conditions was the main outcome measure. General linear modelling was used to analyse the association of vaccine cost, location availability, and sociodemographic and health-related variables with vaccine acceptability. Results: Vaccine cost had the strongest association with acceptability [F (2, 1249) = 832.1; P < 0.0001]; however, factors such as religiosity, political views, a history of various negative sexual health outcomes and previous flu shot receipt were also associated with acceptability.

"Objective: To determine the time between first intercourse and first sexually transmitted infection (STI) with Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, or Trichomonas vaginalis and time between repeated infections. Design: Observational study. Setting: Three adolescent medicine clinics. Participants: A cohort of 386 urban young women aged 14 to 17 years at enrollment. Main Outcome Measures: Age at first intercourse; organism-specific interval between first intercourse and first STI diagnosis; interval between repeated infections; and age at first STI test prior to study participation. Results: Participants had first intercourse at a young age (first, second, and third quartiles were 13, 14, and 15 years of age, respectively). By age 15 years, 25% of the women acquired their first STI, most often C trachomatis. Median interval between first intercourse and first STI diagnosis was 2 years. Within 1 year of first intercourse, 25% had their first C trachomatis infection. Repeated infections were common; within 3.6, 6, and 4.8 months, 25% of the women with prior C trachomatis, N gonorrhoeae, and T vaginalis infection were reinfected with the respective organisms. Considerable delay in STI testing was found for those who began sex at a younger age. The median interval between first sex and first test were 4.9, 3.5, 2.1, 1.8, and 1.2 years for those who had first sex at ages 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14 years, respectively. Conclusions: Timely screening and treatment are important for prevention of STI sequelae. For urban adolescent women, STI screening (especially for C trachomatis) should begin within a year after first intercourse and infected individuals should be retested every 3 to 4-months.",,"XIAO, SHAN/J-2963-2014; Wiehe, Sarah/R-6083-2017","Batteiger, BE|Fortenberry, JD|Katz, BP|Ofner, S|Orr, DP|Tu, WZ|Van der Pol, BJ|Wiehe, SE","Batteiger, Byron E.|Fortenberry, J.

"Recent studies have indicated a role for the endocannabinoid system in the behavioral and physiological effects of alcohol (ethanol), particularly ethanol seeking behaviors. However, its role in modulating binge-like intake and/or the mechanism by which it may exert these effects remain poorly understood. The current study used a newly developed strain-specific animal model of binge drinking, dubbed 'Drinking In the Dark' (DID), to determine if facilitation of the endocannabinoid system with the synthetic cannabinoid agonist WIN 55-212,2 (WIN) modulates binge-like ethanol intake in male C57BL/6J (136) mice. Based on the results of these systemic (i.p.) manipulations, and evidence in support of the involvement of subregions of the Ventral Tegmental Area (VTA) in governing self-administration of ethanol (Rodd-Henricks et al., (2000) Psychopharmacology (Berl) 149(3):217-224) as well as binge-like intake using the DID model (Moore & Boehm, (2009 Behav Neurosci 123(3):555-563), we extended these findings to evaluate the role of the endocannabinoid system within the anterior and posterior sub regions of the VTA using site-specific microinjections. Consistent with previous research, the lowest systemic dose of WIN (0.5 mg/kg) significantly increased ethanol intake in the first 30 minutes of access whereas the two highest doses (11 and 2 mg/kg) decreased ethanol intake within this time interval. Intra-posterior ventral tegmental area (pVTA) (but not aVTA (anterior ventral tegmental area) microinjections elicited time-dependent and dose-dependent increases (0.25 and 0.5 mu g/side) and decreases (2.5 mu g/side) in ethanol intake. Importantly, follow-up studies revealed that in some cases alterations in fluid consumption may have been influenced by competing locomotor activity (or inactivity). The present data are consistent with previous research in that agonism of the endocannabinoid system increases ethanol intake in rodents and implicate the pVTA in the modulation of drinking to intoxication. Moreover, the dose-dependent alterations in locomotor activity emphasize the importance of directly assessing multiple (possibly competing) behaviors when evaluating drug effects on voluntary consumption.

"It is necessary to determine if causal influences on developing antisocial behavior change with age to guide both research and theory on its origins. The extent to which the same genetic factors influence antisocial behavior across 4-17 years of age was estimated using 2,482 sibling pairs of varying genetic relatedness. Assessments of antisocial behavior by mothers (4-9 years), mothers and youth (10-13 years), and youth (14-17 years) reflected the changing validity of informants across development. Genetic influences on antisocial behavior at 14-17 years were entirely shared with those on antisocial behavior at 10-13 years according to both informants. Genetic influences on antisocial behavior at 14-17 years were distinct from those at 4-9 years, however. These age differences in genetic influences cannot be fully distinguished from informant differences across age, but the present findings indicate that youth reported to be persistently antisocial during childhood and adolescence are influenced by one set of genetic factors influencing parent-report conduct problems in childhood and a second set of genetic influences on youth-reported delinquency that come into play around the time of the pubertal transition.",,,"D'Onofrio, BM|Lahey, BB|Rathouz, PJ|Rodgers, JL|Van Hulle, CA|Waldman, ID","D'Onofrio, Brian M.|Lahey, Benjamin B.|Rathouz, Paul J.|Rodgers, Joseph L|Van Hulle, Carol A.|Waldman, Irwin D.",711,-1,,,,,,,-1,,-1,,,,,,,,Article,10.1037/a0016761,,,,721,Clarivate Analytics Web of Science,,,,,,0021-843X,4,,,JOURNAL OF ABNORMAL PSYCHOLOGY,,,,LIFE-COURSE-PERSISTENT|CONDUCT PROBLEMS|SEX-DIFFERENCES|AGED 6-11|CHILDREN|MALES|DELINQUENCY|RELIABILITY|CONTINUITY|YOUTH,-1,,antisocial behavior|genetics|environmental influences|developmental change,,NOV,J,2009,,,,,,"Psychology, Clinical|Psychiatry",,-1,,Psychology; Psychiatry,,16,Developmental Structure of Genetic Influences on Antisocial Behavior Across Childhood and Adolescence,16,,WOS:000271669100003,1,118,,19899841,C:\Users\mginda\Desktop\agc1\wos-extract.isi,"Van Hulle CA, 2009, V118, P711, DOI 10.1037/a0016761"

"Children raised without a biological father in the household have earlier average ages of first sexual intercourse than children raised in father-present households. Competing theoretical perspectives have attributed this either to effects of father absence on socialization and physical maturation or to nonrandom selection of children predisposed for early sexual intercourse into father-absent households. Genetically informative analyses of the children of sister dyads (N = 1,382, aged 14-21 years) support the selection hypothesis: This association seems attributable to confounded risks, most likely genetic in origin, which correlated both with likelihood of father absence and early sexual behavior. This holds implications for environmental theories of maturation and suggests that previous research may have inadvertently overestimated the role of family structure in reproductive maturation.",,,"Brooks-Gunn, J|D'Onofrio, BM|Emery, RE|Harden, KP|Lahey, BB|Mendle, J|Rodgers, JL|Turkheimer, E|Van Hulle, CA","Brooks-Gunn, Jeanne|D'Onofrio, Brian M.|Emery, Robert E.|Harden, K.

"Theoretical models concerning how neighborhood contexts adversely influence juvenile antisocial behavior frequently focus on urban neighborhoods; however, previous studies comparing urban and rural areas on the prevalence of youth antisocial behavior have yielded mixed results. The current study uses longitudinal data on the offspring of a nationally representative sample of mothers (N = 4,886) in the US. There was no relation between density and mother-reported child conduct problems across ages 4-13 years, but youth living in areas of greater population density exhibited more youth self-reported delinquency across 10-17 years. Families often moved to counties with greater or lesser population density, but longitudinal analyses treating population density as a time-varying covariate did not support the hypothesis that living in densely populated counties influenced youth delinquency. Rather, the association between population density and delinquency appears to be due to unmeasured selection variables that differ between families who live in more or less densely populated counties.",,,"D'Onofrio, BM|Lahey, BB|Paige Harden, K|Rodgers, JL|Turkheimer, E|Van Hulle, CA|Waldman, ID","D'Onofrio, Brian M.|Lahey, Benjamin B.|Paige Harden, K.|Rodgers, Joseph L|Turkheimer, Eric|Van Hulle, Carol A.|Waldman, Irwin D.",999,-1,,,,,,,-1,,-1,,,,,,,,Article,10.1111/j.1469-7610.2009.02044.x,,,,1008,Clarivate Analytics Web of Science,,,,,,0021-9630,8,,,JOURNAL OF CHILD PSYCHOLOGY AND PSYCHIATRY,,,,CONDUCT PROBLEMS|CHILD|PREVALENCE|NEIGHBORHOODS|DISORDER|CRIME|AREAS|ONSET|RACE,-1,"Harden, Kathryn/0000-0002-1557-6737",Behavior problems|delinquency|demography|environmental influences|epidemiology,,AUG,J,2009,,,,,,"Psychology, Developmental|Psychiatry|Psychology",,-1,,Psychology; Psychiatry,,17,Population density and youth antisocial behavior,17,,WOS:000268057200014,1,50,,19490315,C:\Users\mginda\Desktop\agc1\wos-extract.isi,"Paige Harden K, 2009, V50, P999, DOI 10.1111/j.1469-7610.2009.02044.x"
"Background: Recent studies suggest that the association between maternal age at childbearing (MAC) and children's disruptive behaviors is the result of family factors that are confounded with both variables, rather than a casual effect of environmental factors specifically related to MAC. These studies, however, relied on restricted samples and did not use the strongest approach to test causal influences. Methods: Using data on 9,171 4-9-year-old and 6,592 10-13-year-old offspring of women from a nationally representative sample of US households, we conducted sibling-comparison analyses. The analyses ruled out all genetic factors that could confound the association, as well as all environmental confounds that differ between unrelated nuclear families, providing a strong test of the causal hypothesis that the environments of children born at different maternal ages influence mother- and self-reported disruptive behaviors. Results: When these genetic and environmental confounds were ruled out as alternative explanations, the relation between environments within nuclear families specifically associated with MAC and disruptive behaviors was robust, with the association being stronger for second- and third-born children. Conclusions: Environmental factors specifically associated with early MAC within nuclear families account for increased risk of offspring disruptive behaviors, especially in later-born children.",,,"D'Onofrio, BM|Goodnight, JA|Lahey, BB|Rathouz, PJ|Rodgers, JL|Van Hulle, CA|Waldman, ID","D'Onofrio, Brian M.|Goodnight, Jackson A.|Lahey, Benjamin B.|Rathouz, Paul J.|Rodgers, Joseph L|Van Hulle, Carol A.|Waldman, Irwin D.",1018,-1,,,,,,,-1,,-1,,,,,,,,Article,10.1111/j.1469-7610.2009.02068.x,,,,1028,Clarivate Analytics Web of Science,,,,,,0021-9630,8,,,JOURNAL OF CHILD PSYCHOLOGY AND PSYCHIATRY,,,,CHILDREN BORN|YOUNG MOTHERS|EXTERNALIZING PROBLEMS|ADOLESCENT PREGNANCY|TEEN MOTHERS|DELINQUENCY|OUTCOMES|YOUTH|BIRTH|DISORDER,-1,,Disruptive behaviors|conduct problems|maternal age at childbearing|sibling comparisons|quasi-experiments,,AUG,J,2009,,,,,,"Psychology, Developmental|Psychiatry|Psychology",,-1,,Psychology; Psychiatry,,38,Maternal age at childbirth and offspring disruptive behaviors: testing the causal hypothesis,38,,WOS:000268057200016,1,50,,19281603,C:\Users\mginda\Desktop\agc1\wos-extract.isi,"D'Onofrio BM, 2009, V50, P1018, DOI 10.1111/j.1469-7610.2009.02068.x"
"Objectives: Understanding the intention-behaviour association with HSV-2 testing is important because it can inform interventions that might be needed to support an effective HSV-2 control programme. This study aims to understand attitudinal, symptomatic and historical precursors to intent to accept, and acceptance of, HSV-2 testing. Methods: The sample included 900 individuals recruited from four sites located in two US cities. Participants completed self-report questionnaires. Expressed intent to accept HSV-2 testing was assessed with an item that asked about acceptance of a test with the same characteristics as the test offered later. The health behaviour outcome was acceptance of the HSV-2 test when it was offered. Predictors examined were STI history, genital symptoms, anxiety and STI-related stigma. Results: Expressed intent significantly predicted test acceptance. However, a number of participants made testing decisions which were at odds with their stated intent. Genital symptoms and STI history significantly predicted both greater intent and test acceptance. STI stigma only predicted lower intent, whereas anxiety only predicted greater acceptance. Intent fully mediated the relationship between genital symptoms and test acceptance, but did not mediate the relationship between STI history and test acceptance. Conclusions: This study suggests that intent does not always predict behaviour, even when the two are measured within close temporal proximity. There are factors that may predict intent only or behaviour only, or may predict behaviour, but solely through influencing intent.

"This study investigated the relationship between cigarette-smoking status and 12-month alcohol and marijuana treatment outcomes in a sample of 1,779 adolescents from the Drug Abuse Treatment Outcomes Study for Adolescents. Participants were classified into four groups based on change in cigarette-smoking status from intake to the 12-month follow-up: persistent smokers, nonsmokers, quitters, and smoking initiators. Logistic regression was used to predict likelihood of relapse to alcohol, marijuana, and other drugs after controlling for intake levels and demographic/treatment characteristics. Results found persistent smokers and smoking initiators to have significantly greater odds of alcohol and marijuana relapse compared with quitters, Furthermore, persistent smokers and smoking initiators were also found to have distinctively shorter periods to marijuana relapse at follow-up. Implications for the implementation of tobacco cessation treatment in the context of substance abuse treatment for adolescents are discussed. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

"Context: This article describes the historical context and current developments in evidence-based practice (EBP) for medicine, nursing, psychology, social work, and public health, as well as the evolution of the seminal ""three circles"" model of evidence-based medicine, highlighting changes in EBP content, processes, and philosophies across disciplines. Methods: The core issues and challenges in EBP are identified by comparing and contrasting EBP models across various health disciplines. Then a unified, transdisciplinary EBP model is presented, drawing on the strengths and compensating for the weaknesses of each discipline. Findings: Common challenges across disciplines include (1) how ""evidence"" should be defined and comparatively weighted; (2) how and when the patient's and/or other contextual factors should enter the clinical decision-making process; (3) the definition and role of the ""expert""; and (4) what other variables should be considered when selecting an evidence-based practice, such as age, social class, community resources, and local expertise. Conclusions: A unified, transdisciplinary EBP model would address historical shortcomings by redefining the contents of each model circle, clarifying the practitioner's expertise and competencies, emphasizing shared decision making, and adding both environmental and organizational contexts.

"Objectives: Clinical Research Informatics, an emerging Sub-domain of Biomedical Informatics, is Currently not well defined. A formal description of CRI including major challenges and Opportunities is needed to direct progress in the field. Design: Given the early stage of CRI knowledge and activity, we engaged in a series of qualitative studies with key stakeholders and opinion leaders to determine the range of challenges and opportunities facing CRI. These phases employed complimentary methods to triangulate upon Our findings. Measurements: Study phases included: 1) a group interview with key stakeholders, 2) an email follow-up survey with a larger group of self-identified CRI professionals, and 3) validation of our results via electronic peer-debriefing and member-checking with a group of CRT-related opinion leaders. Data were collected, transcribed, and organized for formal, independent content analyses by experienced qualitative investigators, followed by an iterative process to identify emergent categorization, and thematic descriptions, of the data. Results: We identified a range of challenges and opportunities facing the CRI domain. These included 13 distinct themes spanning academic, practical, and organizational aspects of CRI. These findings also informed the development of a formal definition of CRI and supported further representations that illustrate areas of emphasis critical to advancing the domain. Conclusions: CRI has emerged as a distinct discipline that faces Multiple challenges and opportunities. The findings presented Summarize those challenges and opportunities and provide a framework that should help inform next steps to advance this important new discipline.

"The study presents a quasi-experimental analysis of data on 9,194 offspring (ages 4-11 years old) of women from a nationally representative U.S. sample of households to test the causal hypotheses about the association between family income and childhood conduct problems (CPs). Comparison of unrelated individuals in the sample indicated a robust inverse association, with the relation being larger at higher levels of income and for male offspring, even when statistical covariates were included to account for measured confounds that distinguish different families. Offspring also were compared to their siblings and cousins who were exposed to different levels of family income in childhood to rule out unmeasured environmental and genetic factors confounded with family income as explanations for the association. In these within-family analyses, boys exposed to lower family income still exhibited significantly higher levels of CPs. When considered in the context of previous studies using different designs, these results support the inference that family income influences CPs, particularly in males, through causal environmental processes specifically related to earnings within the nuclear family.",,,"D'Onofrio, BM|Goodnight, JA|Lahey, BB|Rathouz, PJ|Rodgers, JL|Van Hulle, CA|Waldman, ID","D'Onofrio, Brian M.|Goodnight, Jackson A.|Lahey, Benjamin B.|Rathouz, Paul J.|Rodgers, Joseph L|Van Hulle, Carol A.|Waldman, Irwin D.",415,-1,,,,,,,-1,,-1,,,,,,,,Article,10.1007/s10802-008-9280-2,,,,429,Clarivate Analytics Web of Science,,,,,,0091-0627,3,,,JOURNAL OF ABNORMAL CHILD PSYCHOLOGY,,,,CHILD-DEVELOPMENT|EXTERNALIZING PROBLEMS|SOCIOECONOMIC-STATUS|BEHAVIOR PROBLEMS|WELFARE-REFORM|MENTAL-HEALTH|MISSING DATA|POVERTY|TRAJECTORIES|PSYCHOPATHOLOGY,-1,,Family income|Conduct problems|Externalizing problems|Causality|Quasi-experimental approaches,,APR,J,2009,,,,,,"Psychology, Clinical|Psychology, Developmental",,-1,,Psychology,,20,A Quasi-Experimental Analysis of the Association Between Family Income and Offspring Conduct Problems,20,,WOS:000264483400010,1,37,,19023655,C:\Users\mginda\Desktop\agc1\wos-extract.isi,"D'Onofrio BM, 2009, V37, P415, DOI 10.1007/s10802-008-9280-2"

"In an effort to reduce ""agism"" which is prevalent among medical trainees, a new geriatrics educational experience for medical students aimed at improving attitudes toward older patients was developed. Each 90-minute Older Adult Session included four components: initial reflective writing exercise; introduction to the session; 75-minute dialogue with the ""Council of Elders,"" a group of active, ""well"" older adults; and final reflective writing exercise. The new session was provided to 237 first- and second-year medical students during the 2006/07 academic year at Indiana University School of Medicine. Session evaluation included comparing scores on the 14-item Geriatrics Attitude Scale administered before and after the session, identifying attitude changes in the reflective writing exercises, and a student satisfaction survey. Student responses on the Geriatrics Attitude Scale after the session were significantly improved in seven of 14 items, demonstrating better attitudes toward being with and listening to older people and caring for older patients. Analysis of the reflective writings revealed changing of negative to positive or reinforced positive attitudes in 27% of medical students, with attitudes not discernable in the remaining 73% (except one student, in whom positive attitudes changed to negative). Learner satisfaction with the Older Adult Session was high, with 98% agreeing that the session had a positive effect on insight into the care of older adults. A Council of Elders coupled with a reflective writing exercise is a promising new approach to improving attitudes of medical students toward their geriatric patients.",,,"Bogdewic, SP|Counsell, SR|Frank, KI|Frankel, RM|Inui, TS|Litzelman, DK|Schubert, CC|Sennour, Y|Westmoreland, GR|Wu, JW","Bogdewic, Stephen P.|Counsell, Steven R.|Frank, Kathryn I.|Frankel, Richard M.|Inui, Thomas S.|Litzelman, Debra K.|Schubert, Cathy C.|Sennour, Youcef|Westmoreland, Glenda R.|Wu, Jingwei",315,-1,,,,,,,-1,,-1,,,,,,,,Article,10.1111/j.1532-5415.2008.02102.x,,,,320,Clarivate Analytics Web of Science,,,,,,0002-8614,2,,,JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN GERIATRICS SOCIETY,,,,GERIATRICS|RESIDENTS|EDUCATION|PEOPLE,-1,,,,FEB,J,2009,,,,,,Geriatrics & Gerontology|Gerontology,,-1,,Geriatrics & Gerontology,,27,"Improving Medical Student Attitudes Toward Older Patients Through a ""Council of Elders"" and Reflective Writing Experience",27,,WOS:000262829200019,1,57,,19207146,C:\Users\mginda\Desktop\agc1\wos-extract.isi,"Westmoreland GR, 2009, V57, P315, DOI 10.1111/j.1532-5415.2008.02102.x"
"Impulsivity has long been considered an important risk factor for a variety of maladaptive behaviors, such as alcohol use, drug use, and eating disorders. However, different authors have used the term to mean different things. In recent years, the construct has been disaggregated into five, separate personality traits. In this chapter, after reviewing the varied definitions of impulsivity that have existed in the literature, we review and describe the five traits. Two of them can be best described as deficits in conscientiousness (including lack of persistence in tasks and lack of deliberation before performing tasks), two can be described as emotion-based dispositions (including tendencies to engage in rash actions when experiencing very positive or very negative emotions), and the fifth is sensation seeking. We then discuss the differential correlates of each of these dispositions, the clinical implications of their roles in risky behaviors, and the particular importance of emotion-based rash action. We conclude by proposing new directions of research for the continued study of impulsive behavior-related disorders.",,,"Combs, JL|Cyders, MA|Settles, RE|Smith, GT|Zapolski, TCB","Combs, Jessica L.|Cyders, Melissa A.|Settles, Regan E.|Smith, Gregoty T.|Zapolski, Tamika C.

"Inattentive-hyperactive and oppositional behavior have been hypothesized to be developmental precursors to conduct problems. We tested these hypotheses using a longitudinal sample of 6,466 offspring of women selected from nationally representative US households. Conduct problems across 8-13 years were robustly predicted by conduct problems at 4-7 years, but also were independently predicted to a small extent by both inattentive-hyperactive and oppositional behaviors at 4-7 years. Longitudinal multivariate behavior genetic analyses revealed that the genetic and environmental factors that influence conduct problems at both 4-7 and 8-13 years also influence the putative precursors at 4-7 years. After genetic and environmental influences on conduct problems at 4-7 years were taken into account, however, inattentive-hyperactive and oppositional behavior at 4-7 years shared causal influences with conduct problems 8-13 years to a negligible extent. These findings suggest that after early conduct problems are controlled, little is gained in terms of prediction or understanding genetic and environmental influences on later child conduct problems by treating early inattentive-hyperactive and oppositional behavior as developmental precursors to later conduct problems.",,,"D'Onofrio, BM|Hulle, C|Lahey, BB|Rathouz, PJ|Rodgers, JL|Waldman, ID","D'Onofrio, Brian M.|Hulle, Carol A.

"Epidemiology uses strong sampling methods and study designs to test refutable hypotheses regarding the causes of important health, mental health, and social outcomes. Epidemiologic methods are increasingly being used to move developmental psychopathology from studies that catalogue correlates of child and adolescent mental health to designs that can test rival hypotheses regarding causal genetic and environmental influences. A two-part strategy is proposed for the next phase of epidemiologic research. First, to facilitate the most informed tests of causal hypotheses, it is necessary to develop and test models of the structure of hypothesized genetic and environmental influences on mental health phenotypes. This will involve testing the related hypotheses that there are both (a) dimensions of psychopathology that are distinct in the sense of having at least some unique genetic and/or environmental influences, and (b) higher-order domains of correlated dimensions that are all apparently influenced in part by the same genetic and/or environmental factors. The resulting causal taxonomy would organize tests of causal hypotheses regarding both factors that may broadly increase risk for multiple dimensions of psychopathology and factors that may specifically increase risk for each individual dimension. Second, it is necessary to make greater use of a number of powerful epidemiologic designs that allow rigorous tests of rival hypotheses regarding genetic and environmental causes.",,,"D'Onofrio, BM|Lahey, BB|Waldman, ID","D'Onofrio, Brian M.|Lahey, Benjamin B.|Waldman, Irwin D.",53,-1,,,,,,,-1,,-1,,,,,,,,Article,10.1111/j.1469-7610.2008.01980.x,,,,62,Clarivate Analytics Web of Science,,,,,,0021-9630,2-Jan,,,JOURNAL OF CHILD PSYCHOLOGY AND PSYCHIATRY,,,,ANTISOCIAL-BEHAVIOR|CONDUCT PROBLEMS|ENVIRONMENT INTERACTION|POSTTRAUMATIC-STRESS|DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS|SEX-DIFFERENCES|FOLLOW-UP|PSYCHOPATHOLOGY|DELINQUENCY|COMORBIDITY,-1,,Epidemiology|developmental psychopathology|taxonomy|causal models,,JAN-FEB,J,2009,,,,,,"Psychology, Developmental|Psychiatry|Psychology",,-1,,Psychology; Psychiatry,,29,Using epidemiologic methods to test hypotheses regarding causal influences on child and adolescent mental disorders,30,,WOS:000262889700008,1,50,,19220589,C:\Users\mginda\Desktop\agc1\wos-extract.isi,"Lahey BB, 2009, V50, P53, DOI 10.1111/j.1469-7610.2008.01980.x"
"Objective: To review the use of clinical decision support systems (COSS) available in the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU). Data Sources: Relevant English language publications indexed in Medline, as well as CDSS-related white papers and texts. Study Selection and Data Extraction: Studies related to CDSS were considered. Data Synthesis: CDSS are operationally defined as computer software programs that aid healthcare providers in their clinical decision making. Once used solely for diagnostic support, many CDSS now have the ability to transform clinical practice through interactive assistance with therapeutic best practices. The recent emphasis on improving quality and patient safety through the incorporation of electronic health records as supported by Leapfrog and other agencies has encouraged advancements in the use of CDSS tools that leverage the capabilities of stand-alone electronic health records. CDSS are of particular interest in the PICU where rapid decision-making benefits from tools that can improve patient safety. CDSS have been described in the PICU with varying effects on healthcare outcomes. A growing consensus indicates that the success of such interventions depends as much Or more on how they are implemented and used in such complex environments as on their programming. In the current review, the types and features of various CDSS tools and the supporting evidence are discussed. Factors such as liability, human factors engineering, alert fatigue, and audit trails are also covered. Conclusion: CDSS have the potential to improve clinical practice in PICU settings. Care should be taken when selecting and implementing such systems to achieve the goal of improved clinical practice while avoiding potential adverse impacts sometimes associated with the implementation of new technologies in complex healthcare settings.

"Previous studies have documented that smoking during pregnancy (SDP) is associated with offspring externalizing problems, even when measured covariates were used to control for possible confounds. However, the association may be because of nonmeasured environmental and genetic factors that increase risk for offspring externalizing problems. The current project used the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth and their children, ages 4-10 years, to explore the relations between SDP and offspring conduct problems (CPs), oppositional defiant problems (ODPs), and attention-deficit/hyperactivity problems (ADHPs) using methodological and statistical controls for confounds. When offspring were compared to their own siblings who differed in their exposure to prenatal nicotine, there was no effect of SDP on offspring CP and ODP. This suggests that SDP does not have a causal effect on offspring CP and ODP. There was a small association between SDP and ADHP, consistent with a causal effect of SDP, but the magnitude of the association was greatly reduced by methodological and statistical controls. Genetically informed analyses suggest that unmeasured environmental variables influencing both SDP and offspring externalizing behaviors account for the previously observed associations. That is, the current analyses imply that important unidentified environmental factors account for the association between SDP and offspring externalizing problems, not teratogenic effects of SDP.",,,"D'Onofrio, BM|Harden, KP|Lahey, BB|Rathouz, PJ|Rodgers, JL|Van Hulle, CA|Waldman, ID","D'Onofrio, Brian M.|Harden, K.

"Using National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY) fertility variables, we introduce and illustrate a new genetically-informative design. First, we develop a kinship linking algorithm, using the NLSY79 and the NLSY-Children data to link mothers to daughters and aunts to nieces. Then we construct mother-daughter correlations to compare to aunt-niece correlations, an MDAN design, within the context of the quantitative genetic model. The results of our empirical illustration, which uses DF Analysis and generalized estimation equations (GEE) to estimate biometrical parameters from NLSY79 sister-sister pairs and their children in the NLSY-Children dataset, provide both face validity and concurrent validity in support of the efficacy of the design. We describe extensions of the MDAN design. Compared to the typical within-generational design used in most behavior genetic research, the cross-generational feature of this design has certain advantages and interesting features.

"This study presents an extended children-of-twins model, which allowed the authors to test the direction of the association between parenting and child adjustment. Three mechanisms were examined: direct phenotypic influence of parenting on child behavior (controlling for both parental and child genotype), passive genotype-environment correlation, and evocative genotype-environment correlation. This model was tested with Monte Carlo simulations. The authors generated data sets consisting of 1,000 twin parent pairs together with their children and 1,000 twin children pairs together with their parents. These simulated data sets were then used to estimate the model, and the procedure was repeated 1,000 times. The simulation results showed that this model recovered the true values of parameters with high precision. The model was also applied to an observed data set to analyze, as a first example, the association between maternal emotional overinvolvement and child internalizing problems. The results showed that this association was best explained by evocative genotype-environment correlation.",,,"D'Onofrio, BM|Ganiban, JM|Lichtenstein, P|Narusyte, J|Neiderhiser, JM|Reiss, D|Spotts, EL","D'Onofrio, Brian M.|Ganiban, Jody M.|Lichtenstein, Paul|Narusyte, Jurgita|Neiderhiser, Jenae M.|Reiss, David|Spotts, Erica L.",1591,-1,,,,,,,-1,,-1,,,,,,,,Article,10.1037/a0013911,,,,1603,Clarivate Analytics Web of Science,,,,,,0012-1649,6,,,DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY,,,,ADOLESCENT ANTISOCIAL-BEHAVIOR|EXPRESSED EMOTION|GENETIC INFLUENCE|FAMILY ENVIRONMENT|CHILDHOOD|PSYCHOPATHOLOGY|DEPRESSION|INTERPLAY|SYMPTOMS|TRANSMISSION,-1,"lichtenstein, paul/0000-0003-3037-5287",children-of-twins model|parenting|child adjustment|genotype-environment correlation,,NOV,J,2008,,,,,,"Psychology, Developmental",,-1,,Psychology,,58,Testing Different Types of Genotype-Environment Correlation: An Extended Children-of-Twins Model,59,,WOS:000260930300006,1,44,,18999324,C:\Users\mginda\Desktop\agc1\wos-extract.isi,"Narusyte J, 2008, V44, P1591, DOI 10.1037/a0013911"
"Predictive associations between parenting and temperament during the first year of life and child conduct problems were assessed longitudinally in 1,863 offspring of a representative sample of women. Maternal ratings of infant fussiness, activity level, predictability, and positive affect each independently predicted maternal ratings of conduct problems during ages 4-13 years. Furthermore, a significant interaction indicated that infants who were both low in fussiness and high in predictability were at very low risk for future conduct problems. Fussiness was a stronger predictor of conduct problems in boys whereas fearfulness was a stronger predictor in girls. Conduct problems also were robustly predicted by low levels of early mother-report cognitive stimulation when infant temperament was controlled. Interviewer-rated maternal responsiveness was a robust predictor of conduct problems, but only among infants low in fearfulness. Spanking during infancy predicted slightly more severe conduct problems, but the prediction was moderated by infant fussiness and positive affect. Thus, individual differences in risk for mother-rated conduct problems across childhood are already partly evident in maternal ratings of temperament during the first year of life and are predicted by early parenting and parenting-by-temperament interactions.",,,"D'Onofrio, BM|Keenan, K|Lahey, BB|Rathouz, PJ|Rodgers, JL|Van Hulle, CA|Waldman, ID","D'Onofrio, Brian M.|Keenan, Kate|Lahey, Benjamin B.|Rathouz, Paul J.|Rodgers, Joseph L|Van Hulle, Carol A.|Waldman, Irwin D.",1139,-1,,,,,,,-1,,-1,,,,,,,,Article,10.1007/s10802-008-9247-3,,,,1158,Clarivate Analytics Web of Science,,,,,,0091-0627,8,,,JOURNAL OF ABNORMAL CHILD PSYCHOLOGY,,,,AGE 3 YEARS|BEHAVIOR PROBLEMS|ANTISOCIAL-BEHAVIOR|EXTERNALIZING BEHAVIOR|INFANT TEMPERAMENT|GENDER DIFFERENCES|HOME ENVIRONMENTS|SEX-DIFFERENCES|YOUNG-CHILDREN|ADOLESCENCE,-1,,Infant temperament|Early parenting|Conduct problems,,NOV,J,2008,,,,,,"Psychology, Clinical|Psychology, Developmental",,-1,,Psychology,,48,Temperament and Parenting during the First Year of Life Predict Future Child Conduct Problems,50,,WOS:000259960800001,1,36,,18568397,C:\Users\mginda\Desktop\agc1\wos-extract.isi,"Lahey BB, 2008, V36, P1139, DOI 10.1007/s10802-008-9247-3"

"Background: Pediatric adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) is not well studied in resource-limited settings. Reported ART adherence may be influenced by contextual factors, such as orphan status. kept all scheduled clinic appointments. Understanding contextual factors, Such as orphan status, will strengthen adherence interventions. Objectives: The objectives of this study were to describe self- and proxy-reported pediatric ART adherence in a resource-limited population and to investigate associated contextual factors. Patients and Method: This was a retrospective Study involving pediatric. HIV-infected patients in Western Kenya. We included patients aged 0-14 years, who were on ART and had at least I adherence measurement ( N = 1516). We performed logistic regression to assess the association between orphan status and odds of imperfect adherence, adjusting for sex, age, clinic site, number of adherence measures, and ART duration, stratified by age and ART duration. Results: Of the 1516 children, only 33% had both parents living when they started ART. Twenty-one percent had only father dead, 28% had only mother dead, and 18% had both parents dead. Twenty-nine percent reported imperfect ART adherence. The odds of ART nonadherence increase for children with both parents dead. Fifty-seven percent of children had imperfect clinic adherence. There was no significant association between orphan status and imperfect clinic adherence. Conclusions: The majority of pediatric patients in this resource-limited setting maintained perfect ART adherence, though only half kept all scheduled clinic appointments.

"Recent studies suggest that most of what parents know about their adolescent offspring's whereabouts and companions is the result of youth disclosure, rather than information gained through active parental monitoring. This raises the possibility that parental knowledge is spuriously correlated with youth delinquency solely because the most delinquent youth disclose the least information to parents (because they have the most to hide). We tested this spurious association hypothesis using prospective data on offspring of a nationally representative sample of US women, controlling demographic and contextual covariates. In separate analyses, greater parental knowledge of their offspring's peer associations at both 12-13 years and at 14-15 years was associated with lower odds of being in the top 1 standard deviation of youth-reported delinquency at 16-17 years, controlling for delinquency at the earlier ages. The extent to which parents set limits on activities with peers at 14-15 years did not mediate or moderate the association between parental knowledge and delinquency, but it did independently predict future delinquency among adolescents living in high-risk neighborhoods. This suggests that the association between parental knowledge and future delinquency is not solely spurious; rather parental knowledge and limit setting are both meaningful predictors of future delinquency.",,,"D'Onofrio, BM|Lahey, BB|Rodgers, JL|Van Hulle, CA|Waldman, ID","D'Onofrio, Brian M.|Lahey, Benjamin B.|Rodgers, Joseph L|Van Hulle, Carol A.|Waldman, Irwin D.",807,-1,,,,,,,-1,,-1,,,,,,,,Article,10.1007/s10802-008-9214-z,,,,823,Clarivate Analytics Web of Science,,,,,,0091-0627,6,,,JOURNAL OF ABNORMAL CHILD PSYCHOLOGY,,,,EXTERNALIZING BEHAVIORS|CONDUCT PROBLEMS|YOUTH|REINTERPRETATION|ADJUSTMENT|MULTILEVEL|FAMILIES|CHILDREN|OUTCOMES|MODEL,-1,,parental knowledge|parental limit setting|adolescent delinquency,,AUG,J,2008,,,,,,"Psychology, Clinical|Psychology, Developmental",,-1,,Psychology,,58,Is parental knowledge of their adolescent offspring's whereabouts and peer associations spuriously associated with offspring delinquency?,59,,WOS:000257726600002,1,36,,18214666,C:\Users\mginda\Desktop\agc1\wos-extract.isi,"Lahey BB, 2008, V36, P807, DOI 10.1007/s10802-008-9214-z"
"The children-of-twins design was used to isolate a potentially causal environmental impact of having an alcoholic parent on offspring alcohol use disorder, by an examination of whether the children of alcoholics were at a higher risk for alcohol use disorders than were the children of nonalcoholic parents, even after correlated familial factors were controlled. Participants were 1,224 male and female twins from 836 twin pairs selected from the Australian Twin Registry, 2,334 of the twins' 18-39-year-old offspring, and 983 spouses of the twins. Lifetime histories of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th ed.) alcohol use disorders were obtained by structured, psychiatric, telephone interviews conducted individually with each of the family members. Comparisons of the offspring of twins who were discordant for alcoholism indicated that there was no longer a statistically significant difference between the children of alcoholics and the children of nonalcoholics after genetic and family environmental factors correlated with having an alcoholic parent were controlled.

"Background: Sustaining antiretroviral therapy (ART) adherence requires accurate, consistent monitoring, a particular challenge for low-income countries. The optimal strategy to measure pediatric adherence remains unclear. Objective: To conduct a systematic review of pediatric ART adherence measurement techniques, adherence estimates, and clinical correlates in low-and middle-income countries to inform ART adherence monitoring. Methods: We searched online bibliographic databases, including MEDLINE and EMBASE, using systematic criteria. Two reviewers selected all descriptive or interventional studies involving nonpregnant, HIV-positive individuals <= 18 years old that measured ART adherence in low- or middle-income countries as defined by World Bank criteria. Data were extracted regarding sample characteristics, study setting, measurement strategy, adherence estimate, and adherence correlates. Results: The search yielded 1566 titles, of which 17 met selection criteria. Adherence measurement strategies included self- or proxy-report measures (14 studies), pill counts (4 studies), pharmacy records, drug levels, clinic adherence, and directly observed therapy (1 study each). The self- or proxy-report measures were heterogeneous, and few employed validation strategies. Caregiver-reported adherence was generally higher than self-report estimates. Pill counts revealed lower adherence estimates. Estimates of ART adherence ranged from 49% to 100%, with 76% of articles reporting > 75% adherence. Factors related to family structure, socioeconomic status, disclosure, and medication regimen were all significantly associated with ART adherence. Conclusions: Pediatric HIV care programs in low- and middle-income countries use heterogeneous methods to measure ART adherence. Adherence estimates vary substantially, but most studies from low- and middle-income countries report > 75% adherence, whereas most studies from high-income countries report < 75% adherence.",,"Wiehe, Sarah/R-6083-2017","Nyandiko, WM|Pearce, EC|Vreeman, RC|Wiehe, SE","Nyandiko, Winstone M.|Pearce, Emily C.|Vreeman, Rachel C.|Wiehe, Sarah E.",686,-1,,,,,,,-1,,-1,,,,,,,,Article,10.1097/INF.0b013e31816dd325,,,,691,Clarivate Analytics Web of Science,,,,,,0891-3668,8,,,PEDIATRIC INFECTIOUS DISEASE JOURNAL,,,,HUMAN-IMMUNODEFICIENCY-VIRUS|HIV-INFECTED CHILDREN|SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA|HIV-1-INFECTED CHILDREN|CLINICAL MANAGEMENT|TREATMENT PROGRAM|IMPROVED SURVIVAL|RECOMMENDATIONS|OUTCOMES|EXPERIENCE,-1,"Wiehe, Sarah/0000-0002-8148-0848",adherence|antiretroviral therapy|ART|human immunodeficiency virus|HIV|pediatrics|measurement,,AUG,J,2008,,,,,,Immunology|Infectious Diseases|Pediatrics,,-1,,Immunology; Infectious Diseases; Pediatrics,,109,A systematic review of pediatric adherence to antiretroviral therapy in low- and middle-income countries,110,,WOS:000258209100003,1,27,,18574439,C:\Users\mginda\Desktop\agc1\wos-extract.isi,"Vreeman RC, 2008, V27, P686, DOI 10.1097/INF.0b013e31816dd325"

"BACKGROUND: Calls for organizational culture change are audible in many health care discourses today, including those focused on medical education, patient safety, service quality, and translational research. In spite of many efforts, traditional ""top-down"" approaches to changing culture and relational patterns in organizations often disappoint. OBJECTIVE: In an effort to better align our informal curriculum with our formal competency-based curriculum, Indiana University School of Medicine (IUSM) initiated a school-wide culture change project using an alternative, participatory approach that built on the interests, strengths, and values of IUSM individuals and microsystems. APPROACH: Employing a strategy of ""emergent design,"" we began by gathering and presenting stories of IUSM's culture at its best to foster mindfulness of positive relational patterns already present in the IUSM environment. We then tracked and supported new initiatives stimulated by dissemination of the stories. RESULTS: The vision of a new IUSM culture combined with the initial narrative intervention have prompted significant unanticipated shifts in ordinary activities and behavior, including a redesigned admissions process, new relational practices at faculty meetings, student-initiated publications, and modifications of major administrative projects such as department chair performance reviews and mission-based management. Students' satisfaction with their educational experience rose sharply from historical patterns, and reflective narratives describe significant changes in the work and learning environment. CONCLUSIONS: This case study of emergent change in a medical school's informal curriculum illustrates the efficacy of novel approaches to organizational development. Large-scale change can be promoted with an emergent, non-prescriptive strategy, an appreciative perspective, and focused and sustained attention to everyday relational patterns.",,,"Baldwin, DC|Cottingham, AH|Frankel, RM|Inui, TS|Litzelman, DK|Mossbarger, DL|Suchman, AL|Williamson, PR","Baldwin, DeWitt C., Jr.|Cottingham, Ann H.|Frankel, Richard M.|Inui, Thomas S.|Litzelman, Debra K.|Mossbarger, David L.|Suchman, Anthony L.|Williamson, Penelope R.",715,-1,,,,,,,-1,,-1,,,,,,,,Article,10.1007/s11606-008-0543-y,,,,722,Clarivate Analytics Web of Science,,,,,,0884-8734,6,,,JOURNAL OF GENERAL INTERNAL MEDICINE,,,,OF-MEDICINE|PROFESSIONALISM|CARE,-1,,organizational culture change|learning environment|informal curriculum|medical education|professional competence,,JUN,J,2008,,,,,,"Health Care Sciences & Services|Medicine, General & Internal",,-1,,Health Care Sciences & Services; General & Internal Medicine,,59,Enhancing the informal curriculum of a medical school: A case study in organizational culture change,59,,WOS:000256027500002,1,23,,18389324,C:\Users\mginda\Desktop\agc1\wos-extract.isi,"Cottingham AH, 2008, V23, P715, DOI 10.1007/s11606-008-0543-y"
"Background: Few tools exist to directly measure the microsocial and physical environments of adolescents in circumstances where participatory observation is not practical or ethical. Yet measuring these environments is important as they are significantly associated with adolescent health-risk. For example, health-related behaviors such as cigarette smoking often occur in specific places where smoking may be relatively surreptitious. Results: We assessed the feasibility of using GPS-enabled cell phones to track adolescent travel patterns and gather daily diary data. We enrolled 15 adolescent women from a clinic-based setting and asked them to carry the phones for 1 week. We found that these phones can accurately and reliably track participant locations, as well as record diary information on adolescent behaviors. Participants had variable paths extending beyond their immediate neighborhoods, and denied that GPS-tracking influenced their activity. Conclusion: GPS-enabled cell phones offer a feasible and, in many ways, ideal modality of monitoring the location and travel patterns of adolescents. In addition, cell phones allow space-and time-specific interaction, probing, and intervention which significantly extends both research and health promotion beyond a clinical setting. Future studies can employ GPS-enabled cell phones to better understand adolescent environments, how they are associated with health-risk behaviors, and perhaps intervene to change health behavior.",,"Wiehe, Sarah/R-6083-2017","Carroll, AE|Fortenberry, JD|Haberkorn, KL|Hoch, SC|Liu, GC|Wiehe, SE|Wilson, JS","Carroll, Aaron E.|Fortenberry, J.

"Background: Physician participation in clinical research recruitment efforts is critical to many studies' success, but it is often limited. Use of an Electronic Health Record (EHR)-based, point-of-care Clinical Trial Alert (CTA) approach has led to significant increases in physician-generated recruitment and holds promise for wider benefit. However, little is known about physicians' decision-making regarding recruitment in EHR-equipped settings or the use of such EHR-based approaches. We sought to assess physicians' perceptions about recruitment in general and using the CTA approach in particular. Methods: We developed and delivered a Web-based survey consisting of 15 multiple-choice and free-text questions. Participants included the 114 physician subjects (10 endocrinologists and 104 general internists) who were exposed to CTAs during our preceding 4-month intervention study. Response data were descriptively analyzed, and key findings were compared between groups using appropriate statistical tests. Results: Sixty-nine physicians (61%) responded during the 10-week survey period. Respondents and non-respondents did not differ significantly. Twenty-seven percent of respondents felt very comfortable recruiting patients to trials in general, and 77% appreciated being reminded about a trial via a CTA. Only 11% percent felt the CTA was difficult to use, and 27% felt it was more than somewhat intrusive. Among those who ignored all CTAs, 37% cited a lack of time, 28% knowledge of the patient's ineligibility, and 13% limited knowledge about the trial as their most common reason. Thirty-eight percent wanted more information about the trial presented in the CTA, and 73% were interested in seeing CTAs for future trials. Comments and suggestions were submitted by 33% of respondents and included suggestions for improvement of the CTA approach. Conclusion: Most physicians were comfortable recruiting patients for clinical trials at the pointofcare, found the EHR-based CTA approach useful and would like to see it used in the future. These findings provide insight into the perceived utility of this EHR-based approach to subject recruitment, suggest ways it might be improved, and add to the limited body of knowledge regarding physicians' attitudes toward clinical trial recruitment in EHR-equipped settings.",,"Embi, Peter/E-3030-2011; Embi, Peter/A-8372-2009","Embi, PJ|Harris, CM|Jain, A","Embi, Peter J.|Harris, C.

"Context: Existing research on the neurobehavioral consequences of prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) has not adequately accounted for genetic and environmental confounds. Objective: To examine the association between PAE and offspring externalizing problems in a large representative sample of families in the United States using measured covariates and a quasi-experimental design to account for unmeasured genetic and environmental confounds. Design: This study combines information from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth and the Children of the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth. The analyses statistically controlled for measured characteristics of the mothers and families and exposure to other prenatal psychoactive substances. In the primary analyses, siblings differentially exposed to prenatal alcohol were compared. Setting and Participants: Women were recruited from the community using a stratified and clustered probability sample and were followed longitudinally. The sample included 8621 offspring of 4912 mothers. Main Outcome Measures: Maternal report of conduct problems (CPs) and attention/impulsivity problems (AIPs) during childhood (ages 4-11 years) using standardized assessments related to psychiatric diagnoses. Results: There was an association between PAE and offspring CPs that was independent of confounded genetic and fixed environmental effects and the measured covariates. The CPs in children of mothers who drank daily during pregnancy were 0.35 SD greater than those in children whose mothers never drank during pregnancy. Although AIPs were associated with PAE when comparing unrelated offspring, children whose mothers drank more frequently during pregnancy did not have more AIPs than siblings who were less exposed to alcohol in utero. Additional subsample analyses suggested that maternal polysubstance use during pregnancy may account for the associations between PAE and AIPs. Conclusion: These results are consistent with PAE exerting an environmentally mediated causal effect on childhood CPs, but the relation between PAE and AIPs is more likely to be caused by other factors correlated with maternal drinking during pregnancy.",,,"D'Onofrio, BM|Lahey, BB|Rathouz, PJ|Rodgers, JL|Van Hulle, CA|Waldman, ID","D'Onofrio, Brian M.|Lahey, Benjamin B.|Rathouz, Paul J.|Rodgers, Joseph L|Van Hulle, Carol A.|Waldman, Irwin D.",1296,-1,,,,,,,-1,,-1,,,,,,,,Article,10.1001/archpsyc.64.11.1296,,,,1304,Clarivate Analytics Web of Science,,,,,,0003-990X,11,,,ARCHIVES OF GENERAL PSYCHIATRY,,,,MATERNAL SMOKING|ATTENTION-DEFICIT|HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER|RETROSPECTIVE REPORTS|CONDUCT PROBLEMS|TWINS DESIGN|AGE 15|PREGNANCY|CHILDREN|BEHAVIOR,-1,,,,NOV,J,2007,,,,,,Psychiatry,,-1,,Psychiatry,,79,Causal inferences regarding prenatal alcohol exposure and childhood externalizing problems,79,,WOS:000250701700009,1,64,,17984398,C:\Users\mginda\Desktop\agc1\wos-extract.isi,"D'Onofrio BM, 2007, V64, P1296, DOI 10.1001/archpsyc.64.11.1296"

"Purpose: Psychological functioning, as reflected in psychopathology, psychosocial functioning, gender identity, gender role and cognitive abilities, was examined in a sample of patients with cloacal exstrophy. Materials and Methods: Nine participants 11 to 37 years old completed the evaluation. Standardized measures were used and participant responses were compared to the norms of the various instruments. Gender reassigned participants with cloacal exstrophy were compared with nonassigned participants with cloacal exstrophy. Mean differences between the 2 groups were calculated using the t test. Results: Overall the participants with cloacal exstrophy reported good psychological functioning. Significant differences between reassigned and nonassigned participants were found in the area of depression. All participants had a stable gender identity. XY females showed more male-typical gender roles. There were no significant group differences on cognitive assessments. Reassigned and nonassigned participants did not differ in IQ. Conclusions: Although being born with cloacal exstrophy puts patients at risk for psychopathology and psychosocial problems, it does not necessarily mean that these problems will develop. With the appropriate support these patients can have remarkably well adjusted lives.",,,"Aalsma, MC|Anderson, AM|Hanford, RB|McCauley, E|Mukherjee, B","Aalsma, Matthew C.|Anderson, Amy M.|Hanford, Russell B.|McCauley, Elizabeth|Mukherjee, Bipasha",630,-1,,,,,,,-1,,-1,,,,,,,,Article,10.1016/j.juro.2007.03.144,,,,634,Clarivate Analytics Web of Science,,,,,,0022-5347,2,,,JOURNAL OF UROLOGY,,,,IDENTITY|MALES|SEX,-1,,urogenital system|abnormalities|gender identity|questionnaires|sexuality,,AUG,J,2007,,,,,,Urology & Nephrology,,-1,,Urology & Nephrology,,17,"Psychopathology, psychosocial, gender and cognitive outcomes in patients with cloacal exstrophy",17,,WOS:000248029600078,1,178,,17570426,C:\Users\mginda\Desktop\agc1\wos-extract.isi,"Mukherjee B, 2007, V178, P630, DOI 10.1016/j.juro.2007.03.144"
"Context: The familial nature of childhood conduct problems has been well documented, but few genetically informed studies have explicitly explored the processes through which parental conduct problems influence an offspring's behavior problems. Objective: To delineate the genetic and environmental processes underlying the intergenerational transmission of childhood conduct problems. Design: We used hierarchical linear models to analyze data from a Children of Twins Study, a quasiexperimental design, to explore the extent to which genetic factors common to both generations, unmeasured environmental factors that are shared by twins, or measured characteristics of both parents confound the intergenerational association. Setting: Participants were recruited from the community and completed a semistructured diagnostic telephone interview. Participants: The research used a high-risk sample of twins, their spouses, and their young adult offspring ()n= 2554) from 889 twin families in the Australian Twin Registry, but the analyses used sample weights to produce parameter estimates for the community-based volunteer sample of twins. Main Outcome Measure: Number of conduct disorder symptoms. Results: The magnitude of the intergenerational transmission was significant for all offspring, though it was stronger for males (effect size [Cohen d]= 0.21; 95% confidence interval, 0.15-0.17) than females (d= 0.09; 95% confidence interval, 0.05-0.14). The use of the Children of Twins design and measured covariates indicated that the intergenerational transmission of conduct problems for male offspring was largely mediated by environmental variables specifically related to parental conduct disorder (d= 0.13; 95% confidence interval, 0.02-0.23). In contrast, the intergenerational transmission of conduct problems was not because of environmentally mediated causal processes for female offspring (d=-0.09; 95% confidence interval, -0.20 to 0.03); a common genetic liability accounted for the intergenerational relations. Conclusions: The mechanisms underlying the intergenerational transmission of conduct problems depend on the sex of the offspring. The results are consistent with an environmentally mediated causal role of parental conduct problems on behavior problems in males. Common genetic risk, however, confounds the entire intergenerational transmission in female offspring.",,,"D'Onofrio, BM|Emery, RE|Harden, KP|Heath, AC|Madden, PAF|Martin, NG|Slutske, WS|Turkheimer, E","D'Onofrio, Brian M.|Emery, Robert E.|Harden, K.

"Background: Although parental divorce is associated with increased substance use and internalizing problems, experiencing the separation of one's parents may not cause these outcomes. The relations may be due to genetic or environmental selection factors, characteristics that lead to both marital separation and offspring functioning. Method: We used the Children of Twins (CoT) Design to explore whether unmeasured genetic or environmental factors related to the twin parent, and measured characteristics of both parents, account for the association between parental divorce and offspring substance use and internalizing problems. Results: The association between parental divorce and offspring substance use problems remained robust when controlling for genetic and environmental risk from the twin parent associated with parental divorce, and measured characteristics of both parents. The results do not prove, but are consistent with, a causal connection. In contrast, the analyses suggest that shared genetic liability in parents and their offspring accounts for the increased risk of internalizing problems in adult offspring from divorced families. Conclusions: The study illustrates that unmeasured genetic and environmental selection factors must be considered when studying parental divorce. In explaining associations between parental divorce and young-adult adjustment, our evidence suggests that selection versus causal mechanisms may operate differently for substance abuse (a causal relation) and internalizing problems (an artifact of selection). The CoT design only controls for the genetic and environmental characteristics of one parent; thus, additional genetically informed analyses are needed.",,,"D'Onofrio, BM|Eaves, LJ|Emery, RE|Maes, HH|Silberg, J|Turkheimer, E","D'Onofrio, Brian M.|Eaves, Lindon J.|Emery, Robert E.|Maes, Hermine H.|Silberg, Judy|Turkheimer, Eric",667,-1,,,,,,,-1,,-1,,,,,,,,Article,10.1111/j.1469-7610.2007.01741.x,,,,675,Clarivate Analytics Web of Science,,,,,,0021-9630,7,,,JOURNAL OF CHILD PSYCHOLOGY AND PSYCHIATRY,,,,MARITAL INSTABILITY|ASSOCIATION|ADJUSTMENT|FAMILIES|ADULTS|MODEL,-1,,behavioural genetics|divorce|substance use|depression|alcohol abuse|children of twins,,JUL,J,2007,,,,,,"Psychology, Developmental|Psychiatry|Psychology",,-1,,Psychology; Psychiatry,,53,A Children of Twins Study of parental divorce and offspring psychopathology,54,,WOS:000247477200005,1,48,,17593147,C:\Users\mginda\Desktop\agc1\wos-extract.isi,"D'Onofrio BM, 2007, V48, P667, DOI 10.1111/j.1469-7610.2007.01741.x"

"Sex differences in the causes of self-reported adolescent delinquency were examined in full and half siblings born to a nationally representative sample of women in the United States. Qualitative sex differences in the genes that influence delinquency were not detected. Similarly, the proportions of variance in both aggressive and nonaggressive delinquency attributable to genetic and environmental influences did not differ significantly between girls and boys. Nonetheless, total variance in delinquency was greater among boys, and a scalar sex-differences model suggested that genetic and environmental influences on delinquency have less effect on population variation in delinquency among girls. Similarly, a test of the polygenic multiple threshold model suggested that girls require greater causal liability for the expression of delinquency than boys.",,,"D'Onofrio, BM|Lahey, BB|Rodgers, JL|Van Hulle, CA|Waldman, ID","D'Onofrio, Brian M.|Lahey, Benjamin B.|Rodgers, Joseph L|Van Hulle, Carol A.|Waldman, Irwin D.",236,-1,,,,,,,-1,,-1,,,,,,,,Article,10.1037/0021-843X.116.2.236,,,,248,Clarivate Analytics Web of Science,,,,,,0021-843X,2,,,JOURNAL OF ABNORMAL PSYCHOLOGY,,,,NONAGGRESSIVE ANTISOCIAL-BEHAVIOR|ENVIRONMENTAL-INFLUENCES|CONDUCT PROBLEMS|DF ANALYSIS|CHILDHOOD|TWIN|DISORDER|ETIOLOGY|PSYCHOPATHOLOGY|AGGRESSION,-1,,juvenile delinquency|human sex differences|heritability|polygenic multiple threshold model,,MAY,J,2007,,,,,,"Psychology, Clinical|Psychiatry",,-1,,Psychology; Psychiatry,,32,Sex differences in the causes of self-reported adolescent delinquency,32,,WOS:000246502900002,1,116,,17516757,C:\Users\mginda\Desktop\agc1\wos-extract.isi,"Van Hulle CA, 2007, V116, P236, DOI 10.1037/0021-843X.116.2.236"
"There is growing recognition in the medical community that being a good doctor requires more than strong scientific knowledge and excellent clinical skills. Many key qualities are essential to providing comprehensive care, including the abilities to communicate effectively with patients and colleagues, act in a professional manner, cultivate an awareness of one's own values and prejudices, and provide care with an understanding of the cultural and spiritual dimensions of patients' lives. To ensure that Indiana University School of Medicine (IUSM) graduates demonstrate this range of abilities, IUSM has undertaken a substantial transformation of both its formal curriculum and learning environment (informal curriculum). The authors provide an overview of IUSM's two-part initiative to develop and implement a competency-based formal curriculum that requires students to demonstrate proficiency in nine core competencies and to create simultaneously an informal curriculum that models and supports the moral, professional, and humane values expressed in the formal curriculum. The authors describe the institutional and curricular transformations that have enabled and furthered the new IUSM curricular goals: changes in education administration; education implementation, assessment, and curricular design; admissions procedures; performance tracking; and the development of an electronic infrastructure to facilitate the expanded curriculum. The authors address the cost of reform and the results of two progress reviews. Specific case examples illustrate the interweaving of the formal competency curriculum through the students' four years of training, as well as techniques that are being used to positively influence the IUSM informal curriculum.",,,"Cottingham, AH|Litzelman, DK","Cottingham, Ann H.|Litzelman, Debra K.",410,-1,,,,,,,-1,,-1,,,,,,,,Article,10.1097/ACM.0b013e31803327f3,,,,421,Clarivate Analytics Web of Science,,,,,,1040-2446,4,,,ACADEMIC MEDICINE,,,,,-1,,,,APR,J,2007,,,,,,"Education, Scientific Disciplines|Health Care Sciences & Services",,-1,,Education & Educational Research; Health Care Sciences & Services,,49,The new formal competency-based curriculum and informal curriculum at Indiana University School of Medicine: Overview and five-year analysis,50,,WOS:000245580400015,1,82,,17414200,C:\Users\mginda\Desktop\agc1\wos-extract.isi,"Litzelman DK, 2007, V82, P410, DOI 10.1097/ACM.0b013e31803327f3"

"The Children-of-Twins design was used to test whether associations between marital conflict frequency and conduct problems can be replicated within the children of discordant twin pairs. A sample of 2,051 children (age 14-39 years) of 1,045 twins was used to estimate the genetic and environmental influences on marital conflict and determine whether genetic or environmental selection processes underlie the observed association between marital conflict and conduct problems. Results indicate that genetic and nonshared environmental factors influence the risk of marital conflict. Furthermore, genetic influences mediated the association between marital conflict frequency and conduct problems. These results highlight the need for quasiexperimental designs in investigations of intergenerational associations.",,,"D'Onofrio, BM|Emery, RE|Harden, KP|Heath, AC|Martin, NG|Slutske, WS|Turkheimer, E","D'Onofrio, Brian M.|Emery, Robert E.|Harden, K.

"Accurate descriptions of sex differences in the development of childhood conduct problems and adolescent delinquency will inform theories of their causes in fundamentally important ways. Using data on 4,572 offspring of a national sample of women, we tested descriptive hypotheses regarding sex differences. As predicted, the magnitude of sex differences varied with age, suggesting that multiple processes differentially influence levels of these behaviors in females and males across development. During childhood, boys scored lower on measures of cognitive ability and exhibited lower sociability and compliance and greater hyperactivity, oppositional behavior, and conduct problems. Most of these variables were associated with childhood conduct problems and adolescent delinquency equally in females and males, but maternal delinquency and early childhood sociability were correlated more strongly with childhood conduct problems in males and childhood compliance predicted adolescent delinquency more strongly in females. Both sexes exhibited both childhood-onset and adolescent-onset trajectories of delinquency. Although more males followed a childhood-onset trajectory, there were few sex differences in the early childhood risk correlates of either delinquency trajectory.",,,"D'Onofrio, BM|Keenan, K|Lahey, BB|Pedlow, S|Rathouz, PJ|Rodgers, JL|Van Hulle, CA|Waldman, ID","D'Onofrio, Brian M.|Keenan, Kate|Lahey, Benjamin B.|Pedlow, Steven|Rathouz, Paul J.|Rodgers, Joseph L|Van Hulle, Carol A.|Waldman, Irwin D.",737,-1,,,,,,,-1,,-1,,,,,,,,Article,10.1007/s10802-006-9064-5,,,,755,Clarivate Analytics Web of Science,,,,,,0091-0627,5,,,JOURNAL OF ABNORMAL CHILD PSYCHOLOGY,,,,LIFE-COURSE-PERSISTENT|ANTISOCIAL-BEHAVIOR|CHILDHOOD|TRAJECTORIES|ADOLESCENCE|CHILDREN|MALES|BOYS|PSYCHOPATHOLOGY|PREDICTORS,-1,,human sex differences|conduct problems|juvenile delinquency|developmental trajectories,,OCT,J,2006,,,,,,"Psychology, Clinical|Psychology, Developmental",,-1,,Psychology,,84,Testing descriptive hypotheses regarding sex differences in the development of conduct problems and delinquency,86,,WOS:000241948500013,1,34,,17033935,C:\Users\mginda\Desktop\agc1\wos-extract.isi,"Lahey BB, 2006, V34, P737, DOI 10.1007/s10802-006-9064-5"

"Background: Information about drug withdrawals may not reach patients in a timely manner, and this could result in adverse events. Increasingly, the public turns to consumer health websites for health information, but such sites may not update their content for days or weeks following important events like Food and Drug Administration (FDA) drug withdrawal actions. There is no recognized standard for how quickly consumer health websites should respond to such events, and reports addressing this issue are lacking. Objective: The objective of this study was to develop and implement an approach to enhance the efficiency with which a consumer health website (NetWellness.org) responds to FDA drug withdrawal actions. Methods: Evaluation of the current approach used by NetWellness staff to update content affected by FDA action revealed a slow process driven by the goal of performing thorough and comprehensive review and editing. To achieve our desired goal of accurately updating affected content within 24 hours of FDA action, we developed a strategy that included rapid updating of affected Web pages with warning boxes and hyperlinks to the information about the withdrawal. With the next FDA withdrawal event, that of valdecoxib (Bextra) on April 7, 2005, we applied this new approach, observed the time and resource requirements, and monitored the rate at which consumers viewed the updated information to gauge its potential impact. Results: Application of the new approach allowed one person to modify the affected Web pages in less than I hour and within 18 hours of the FDA announcement. Using the old strategy, response to a similar event, the withdrawal of rofecoxib (Vioxx) 6 months earlier, had taken over 3 weeks and the efforts of several personnel. Updated valdecoxib content received 188 hits within the first month and 4285 hits within 1 year. Conclusions: Rapid updating of a consumer health website's content in response to an FDA drug withdrawal event was easily accomplished by applying the approach described. This allowed consumers to view accurate information regarding the withdrawn drug much sooner than would otherwise have been the case. Given that consumers increasingly turn to websites for their health information, adoption of a rapid response standard for important health events like FDA drug withdrawals should be considered by the consumer health informatics community.",,"Embi, Peter/A-8372-2009; Embi, Peter/E-3030-2011; kishman, charles/H-5248-2013","Acharya, P|Embi, PJ|Haag, D|Kishman, CP|Marine, S|McCuistion, M","Acharya, Prasad|Embi, Peter J.|Haag, Doris|Kishman, Charles P.|Marine, Stephen|McCuistion, Mark",,-1,,,,,,,-1,,-1,,,16-May-06,,"Phoenix, AZ",,Spring Congress of the American-Medical-Informatics-Association,Article; Proceedings Paper,10.2196/jmir.8.3.e16,,,,,Clarivate Analytics Web of Science,,,,,,1438-8871,3,,,JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH,,,,NOTIFYING PATIENTS|INFORMATION|ROFECOXIB|RECALL,-1,"kishman, charles/0000-0002-0972-3219; McCuistion, Mark/0000-0002-1017-6603",consumer health information|drug and narcotic control|cyclooxygenase inhibitors|adverse effects|time factors,,JUL-SEP,J,2006,,,,,,Health Care Sciences & Services|Medical Informatics,,-1,,Health Care Sciences & Services; Medical Informatics,,1,Responding rapidly to FDA drug withdrawals: Design and application of a new approach for a consumer health website,1,,WOS:000241895100008,1,8,,,C:\Users\mginda\Desktop\agc1\wos-extract.isi,"Embi PJ, 2006, V8, DOI 10.2196/jmir.8.3.e16"
"Parental divorce is associated with problematic offspring adjustment, but the relation may be due to shared genetic or environmental factors. One way to test for these confounds is to study offspring of twins discordant for divorce. The current analyses used this design to separate the mechanisms responsible for the association between parental divorce, experienced either before or after the age of 16, and offspring well-being. The results were consistent with a causal role of divorce in earlier initiation of sexual intercourse and emotional difficulties, in addition to a greater probability of educational problems, depressed mood, and suicidal ideation. In contrast, the increased risk for cohabitation and earlier initiation of drug use was explained by selection factors, including genetic confounds.",,,"D'Onofrio, BM|Emery, RE|Heath, AC|Madden, PAF|Martin, NG|Slutske, WS|Turkheimer, E","D'Onofrio, Brian M.|Emery, Robert E.|Heath, Andrew C.|Madden, Pamela A.

"The relationship among three personal fables (omnipotence, invulnerability, personal uniqueness), narcissism, and mental health variables was assessed in a large, cross-sectional sample of adolescents drawn from Grades 6 (n = 94), 8 (n = 223), 10 (n = 142), and 12 (n = 102). Participants responded to the New Personal Fable Scale, the Narcissistic Personality Inventory, the Children's Depression Inventory, three indices of suicidal ideation, an inventory of delinquent risk behaviors, the Global Self-Worth scales from the Self-Perception Profiles for Children and for Adolescents, and two subscales from the Self-Image Questionnaire for Young Adolescents. The results showed that omnipotence and narcissism strongly counterindicated internalizing symptomatology, and were robust predictors of positive mental health and adjustment. Invulnerability was strongly associated with risk behaviors. Personal uniqueness was strongly associated with depression and suicidal ideation, a relationship that increased with age. Hence, personal fable ideation is a multidimensional construct with differential implications for adolescent mental health. Adolescent fables of invulnerability and personal uniqueness are risk factors for externalizing and internalizing symptoms, respectively, while ""narcissistic omnipotence"" is associated with competence. Implications for theory, practice, and future research are discussed.

"Purpose: The role of closeness of sexual partners to family and friends (i.e., how well the participant's family and friends knew their primary sexual partner) to a variety of relationship and sexual behavior measures was explored. Methods: A sample of 151 adolescent females (aged 14-17 years) was assessed. Areas assessed include family and friend closeness, relationship intimacy, length of sexual relationship, and condom use. Results: Bivariate correlations indicated that the integration of the sexual partner into the family and friend networks was related to greater relationship intimacy. Lowered condom use was related to a number of measures, including increased relationship intimacy and increased family closeness. A path analysis was conducted to assess for direct and indirect effects of family closeness, friend closeness, relationship length, and relationship intimacy on condom use. Social network closeness in family and friend networks was implicated in lowered condom use through higher relationship intimacy within adolescent dyads. Conclusions: Social network theory is useful in understanding adolescent health-related behavior. In particular, the integration of adolescent sexual partners into both family and friend networks is related to the expression of adolescent sexual behavior. 0 2006 Society for Adolescent Medicine.

"A two-step cluster analytic strategy was used in two studies to identify an empirically derived typology of narcissism in late adolescence. In Study 1, late adolescents (N = 204) responded to the profile of narcissistic dispositions and measures of grandiosity (""superiority"") and idealization (""goal instability"") inspired by Kohut's theory, along with several College Adjustment Scales and a measure of pathology of separation-individuation. Cluster analysis revealed three clusters: covert narcissists (N = 71), moderate narcissists (N = 55) and overt narcissists (N = 74). Moderate narcissists had significantly lower means scores on indices of anxiety, relationship problem, depression, esteem- and family problems and pathology of separation-individuation. The overt and covert clusters showed comparable levels of dysfunction on most indices of adjustment. This general pattern was replicated in Study 2 (N = 210). Moderate narcissists showed a uniform profile of good adjustment, whereas covert and overt narcissist clusters showed a pervasive pattern of dysfunction. Results support the claim that narcissism has ""two faces"" and that a moderate degree of narcissism is associated with fewer adjustment problems or psychological symptoms. Directions for future research are discussed. (c) 2005 The Association for Professionals in Services for Adolescents. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

"Parental divorce is associated with a number of emotional and behavioral problems in young-adult offspring, but theoretical and empirical considerations suggest that the relation may be partially or fully accounted for by passive gene-environment correlation or environmental selection characteristics. The current study used the Children of Twins Design to explore whether shared environmental or genetic factors confound the relationship between parental marital instability and measures of psychopathology. Comparisons of the offspring of adult twins in Australia on 3 factors of abnormal behavior, including drug and alcohol, behavioral, and internalizing problems, suggest that environmental influences associated with divorce account for the higher rates of psychopathology. The results are consistent with a causal connection between marital instability and psychopathology in young-adult offspring.",,,"D'Onofrio, BM|Emery, RE|Heath, AC|Madden, PAF|Martin, NG|Slutske, WS|Turkheimer, E","D'Onofrio, Brian M.|Emery, Robert E.|Heath, Andrew C.|Madden, Pamela A.

"Background: Failure to recruit a sufficient number of eligible subjects in a timely manner represents a major impediment to the success of clinical trials. Physician participation is vital to trial recruitment but is often limited. Methods: After 12 months of traditional recruitment to a clinical trial, we activated our electronic health record (EHR)-based clinical trial alert (CTA) system in selected outpatient clinics of a large, US academic health care system. When a patient's EHR data met selected trial criteria during the subsequent 4-month intervention period, the CTA prompted physician consideration of the patient's eligibility and facilitated secure messaging to the trial's coordinator. Subjects were the 114 physicians practicing at selected EHR-equipped clinics throughout our study. We compared differences in the number of physicians participating in recruitment and their recruitment rates before and after CTA activation. Results: The CTA intervention was associated with significant increases in the number of physicians generating referrals (5 before and 42 after; P <.001) and enrollments (5 before and 11 after; P=.03), a 10-fold increase in those physicians' referral rate (5.7/mo before and 59.5/mo after; rate ratio, 10.44; 95% confidence interval, 7.98-13.68; P <.001), and a doubling of their enrollment rate (2.9/mo before and 6.0/mo after; rate ratio, 2.06; 95% confidence interval, 1.22-3.46; P=.007). Conclusions: Use of an EHR-based CTA led to significant increases in physicians' participation in and recruitment rates to an ongoing clinical trial. Given the trend toward the EHR implementation in health care centers engaged in clinical research, this approach may represent a much-needed solution to the common problem of inadequate trial recruitment.",,"Embi, Peter/A-8372-2009; Embi, Peter/E-3030-2011","Bizjack, S|Clark, J|Embi, PJ|Harris, CM|Hornung, RW|Jain, A","Bizjack, S|Clark, J|Embi, Peter J.|Harris, C.

"Background: Several systematic reviews of school-based smoking prevention trials have shown short-term decreases in smoking prevalence but have not examined long-term follow-up evaluation. The purpose of this study was to conduct a systematic review of rigorously evaluated interventions for school-based smoking prevention with long-term follow-up data. Methods: We searched online bibliographic databases and reference lists from review articles and selected studies. We included all school-based, randomized, controlled trials of smoking prevention with follow-up evaluation to age 18 or 12th grade and at least 1 year after intervention ended, and that had smoking prevalence as a primary outcome. The primary outcome was current smoking prevalence (defined as at least I cigarette in the past month). Results: The abstracts or full-text articles of 177 relevant studies were examined, of which 8 met the selection criteria. The 8 articles included studies differing in intervention intensity, presence of booster sessions, follow-up periods, and attrition rates. Only one study showed decreased smoking prevalence in the intervention group. Conclusions: Few studies have evaluated the long-term impact of school-based smoking prevention programs rigorously. Among the 8 programs that have follow-up data to age 18 or 12th grade, we found little to no evidence of long-term effectiveness. 0 2005 Society for Adolescent Medicine.

"Purpose. To develop an instrument for measuring medical educators' responses to learners' lapses in professional behavior. Method. In 1999, at the Indiana University School of Medicine, a 22-item checklist of behaviors was developed to describe common responses used by educators responding to learners' lapses in professional behavior. Four medical students were trained to portray lapses in professional behaviors. These students and seven clinical observers trained to categorize behaviors as present or absent. Interrater reliability was assessed during 18 objective structured teaching evaluations (OSTEs). Videotaped OSTEs were coded twice at a one-month interval for test-retest reliability. Items were classified as low, moderate, or high inference behaviors. Script realism and educator effectiveness were assessed. Results. Educators rated OSTE scripts as realistic. Raters observed an average of 6 +/- 2 educator behaviors in reaction to learners' lapses in professional behavior. Educators' responses were rated as moderately effective. More experienced educators attempted more interventions and were more effective. Agreement was high among raters (86% +/- 7%), while intraclass correlation coefficients decreased with increasing inference level. From videotaped OSTEs, raters scored each behavior identically 86% of the time. Conclusions. Accurate feedback on educators' interactions in addressing learners' professionalism is essential for faculty development. Traditionally, educators have felt that faculty's responses to learners' lapses in professional behavior were difficult to observe and categorize. These data suggest that educators' responses to learners' lapses in professional behavior can be defined and reliably coded. This work will help provide objective feedback to faculty when engaging learners about lapses in professional behavior.",,,"Bogdewic, SP|Gaffney, M|Galvin, M|Lane, K|Litzelman, DK|Mitchell, G|Seshadri, R|Srinivasan, M|Treadwell, P|Willis, L|Zhou, W","Bogdewic, Stephen P.|Gaffney, M|Galvin, M|Lane, Kathleen|Litzelman, Debra K.|Mitchell, G|Seshadri, R|Srinivasan, M|Treadwell, P|Willis, L|Zhou, W",888,-1,,,,,,,-1,,-1,,,,,,,,Article,10.1097/00001888-200409000-00017,,,,896,Clarivate Analytics Web of Science,,,,,,1040-2446,9,,,ACADEMIC MEDICINE,,,,MEDICAL PROFESSIONALISM,-1,,,,SEP,J,2004,,,,,,"Education, Scientific Disciplines|Health Care Sciences & Services",,-1,,Education & Educational Research; Health Care Sciences & Services,,12,Developing an OSTE to address lapses in learners' professional behavior and an instrument to code educators' responses,12,,WOS:000223562200013,1,79,,15326017,C:\Users\mginda\Desktop\agc1\wos-extract.isi,"Srinivasan M, 2004, V79, P888, DOI 10.1097/00001888-200409000-00017"

"Objective: Computerized physician documentation (CPD) has been implemented throughout the nation's Veterans Affairs Medical Centers (VAMCs) and is likely to increasingly replace handwritten documentation in other institutions. The use of this technology may affect educational and clinical activities, yet little has been reported in this regard. The authors conducted a qualitative study to determine the perceived impacts of CPD among faculty and housestaff in a VAMC. Design: A cross-sectional study was conducted using semistructured interviews with faculty (n = 10) and a group interview with residents (n = 10) at a VAMC teaching hospital. Measurements: Content analysis of field notes and taped transcripts were done by two independent reviewers using a grounded theory approach. Findings were validated using member checking and peer debriefing. Results: Four major themes were identified: (1) improved availability of documentation; (2) changes in work processes and communication; (3) alterations in document structure and content; and (4) mistakes, concerns, and decreased confidence in the data. With a few exceptions, subjects felt documentation was more available, with benefits for education and patient care. Other impacts of CPD were largely seen as detrimental to aspects of clinical practice and education, including documentation quality, workflow, professional communication, and patient care. Conclusion: CPD is perceived to have substantial positive and negative impacts on clinical and educational activities and environments. Care should be taken when designing, implementing, and using such systems to avoid or minimize any harmful impacts. More research is needed to assess the extent of the impacts identified and to determine the best strategies to effectively deal with them.",,"Embi, Peter/E-3030-2011; Embi, Peter/A-8372-2009","Bowen, JL|Cooney, TG|Embi, PJ|Gorman, PN|Logan, JR|Yackel, TR","Bowen, JL|Cooney, Thomas G.|Embi, Peter J.|Gorman, PN|Logan, Judith R.|Yackel, Thomas R.",300,-1,,,,,,,-1,,-1,,,,,,,,Article,10.1197/jamia.M1525,,,,309,Clarivate Analytics Web of Science,,,,,,1067-5027,4,,,JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MEDICAL INFORMATICS ASSOCIATION,,,,ACADEMIC MEDICAL-CENTER|ORDER ENTRY|INFORMATION-SYSTEM|DATA-COLLECTION|INTENSIVE-CARE|PATIENT RECORD|IMPLEMENTATION|CLINICIAN|GUIDE,-1,,,,JUL-AUG,J,2004,,,,,,"Computer Science, Information Systems|Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications|Health Care Sciences & Services|Information Science & Library Science|Medical Informatics",,-1,,Computer Science; Health Care Sciences & Services; Information Science & Library Science; Medical Informatics,,105,Impacts of computerized physician documentation in a teaching hospital: Perceptions of faculty and resident physicians,105,,WOS:000222667800011,1,11,1527-974X,15064287,C:\Users\mginda\Desktop\agc1\wos-extract.isi,"Embi PJ, 2004, V11, P300, DOI 10.1197/jamia.M1525"

"The social environment or ""informal"" curriculum of a medical school profoundly influences students' values and professional identities. The Indiana University School of Medicine is seeking to foster a social environment that consistently embodies and reinforces the values of its formal competency-based curriculum. Using an appreciative narrative-based approach, we have been encouraging students, residents, and faculty to be more mindful of relationship dynamics throughout the school. As participants discover how much relational capacity already exists and how widespread is the desire for a more collaborative environment, their perceptions of the school seem to shift, evoking behavior change and hopeful expectations for the future.",,,"Frankel, RM|Inui, TS|Litzelman, DK|Mossbarger, DL|Suchman, AL|Williamson, PR","Frankel, Richard M.|Inui, Thomas S.|Litzelman, Debra K.|Mossbarger, David L.|Suchman, Anthony L.|Williamson, Penelope R.",501,-1,,,,,,,-1,,-1,,,,,,,,Article,10.1111/j.1525-1497.2004.30157.x,,,,504,Clarivate Analytics Web of Science,,,Relationship-Centered Care Initia,,,0884-8734,5,,,JOURNAL OF GENERAL INTERNAL MEDICINE,,,,EDUCATION,-1,,medical education|professionalism|curriculum|competencies|relationship-centered care,2,MAY,J,2004,,,,,,"Health Care Sciences & Services|Medicine, General & Internal",,-1,,Health Care Sciences & Services; General & Internal Medicine,,112,Toward an informal curriculum that teaches professionalism - Transforming the social environment of a medical school,112,,WOS:000221452500004,1,19,,15109312,C:\Users\mginda\Desktop\agc1\wos-extract.isi,"Suchman AL, 2004, V19, P501, DOI 10.1111/j.1525-1497.2004.30157.x"

"A 51-year-old woman with CREST syndrome (calcinosis, Raynaud phenomenon, esophageal dysmotility, sclerodactyly, and telangiectasia) developed stepwise progressive focal neurological deficits without zoster rash. Multifocal ischemic infarcts were seen on magnetic resonance imaging, and cerebral angiography revealed focal stenosis of arteries affecting the intracranial circulation. A brain biopsy was nondiagnostic. Virological etiology of the disease was verified by the detection of varicella-zoster virus antibody in cerebrospinal fluid and by reduced serum-cerebrospinal fluid varicella-zoster virus IgG ratios (compared with normally high ratios of total IgG and albumin). Treatment with intravenous acyclovir stabilized but did not significantly improve her neurological deficits.",,"Embi, Peter/J-5078-2012; Embi, Peter/A-8372-2009; Embi, Peter/E-3030-2011","Calabrese, LH|Embi, PJ|Forghani, B|Gilden, DH|Lederman, RJ|Russman, AN","Calabrese, LH|Embi, Peter J.|Forghani, B|Gilden, DH|Lederman, RJ|Russman, AN",1607,-1,,,,,,,-1,,-1,,,,,,,,Article,10.1001/archneur.60.11.1607,,,,1609,Clarivate Analytics Web of Science,,,,,,0003-9942,11,,,ARCHIVES OF NEUROLOGY,,,,INTRATHECAL SYNTHESIS|CEREBROSPINAL-FLUID|ANTIBODIES|DNA,-1,,,,NOV,J,2003,,,,,,Clinical Neurology,,-1,,Neurosciences & Neurology,,18,Multifocal varicella-zoster virus vasculopathy without rash,20,,WOS:000186611800015,1,60,,14623735,C:\Users\mginda\Desktop\agc1\wos-extract.isi,"Russman AN, 2003, V60, P1607, DOI 10.1001/archneur.60.11.1607"

"Background: The Internet has become essential to the residency application process. In recent years, applicants and residency programs have used the Internet-based tools of the National Residency Matching Program (NRMP, the Match) and the Electronic Residency Application Service (ERAS) to process and manage application and Match information. In addition, many residency programs have moved their recruitment information from printed brochures to Web sites. Despite this change, little is known about how applicants use residency program Web sites and what constitutes optimal residency Web site content, information that is critical to developing and maintaining such sites. Objective: To study the use and perceived utility of Web-based residency program information by surveying applicants to an internal medicine program. Methods: Our sample population was the applicants to the Oregon Health & Science University Internal Medicine Residency Program who were invited for an interview. We solicited participation using the group e-mail feature available through the Electronic Residency Application Service Post-Office application. To minimize the possibility for biased responses, the study was confined to the period between submission of National Residency Matching Program rank-order lists and release of Match results. Applicants could respond using an anonymous Web-based form or by reply to the e-mail solicitation. We tabulated responses, calculated percentages for each, and performed a qualitative analysis of comments. Results: Of the 431 potential participants, 218 responded (51%) during the study period. Ninety-nine percent reported comfort browsing the Web; 52% accessed the Web primarily from home. Sixty-nine percent learned about residency Web sites primarily from residency-specific directories while 19% relied on general directories. Eighty percent found these sites helpful when deciding where to apply, 69% when deciding where to interview, and 36% when deciding how to rank order programs for the Match. Forty-nine percent found sites most useful in deciding where to apply, while 40% found them most useful while preparing for their interviews. Seventy-two percent felt that a ""complete"" Web site could substitute for a mailed printed brochure. Qualitative analysis identified additional important information needs. Conclusions: Applicants are turning to residency Web sites for information during critical phases of the application process. Though usually helpful, many of these sites are felt to be incomplete and may not be meeting important applicant information needs. These findings should be useful to those involved in residency recruitment efforts and in counseling applicants.",,"Embi, Peter/E-3030-2011","Cooney, TG|Desai, S|Embi, PJ","Cooney, Thomas G.|Desai, Sima|Embi, Peter J.",,-1,,,,,,,-1,,-1,,,,,,,,Article,10.2196/jmir.5.3.e22,,,,,Clarivate Analytics Web of Science,,,,,,1438-8871,3,,,JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH,,,e22,,-1,,Internship and residency|Internet|education|medical|graduate|job application|career choice|pamphlets,,,J,2003,,,,,,Health Care Sciences & Services|Medical Informatics,,-1,,Health Care Sciences & Services; Medical Informatics,,27,Use and Utility of Web-Based Residency Program Information: A Survey of Residency Applicants,27,,WOS:000207625200007,1,5,,14517113,C:\Users\mginda\Desktop\agc1\wos-extract.isi,"Embi PJ, 2003, V5, DOI 10.2196/jmir.5.3.e22"
"The consistency of childhood sexual abuse (CSA) reporting was explored in this study. Two-hundred seventeen adolescents and young adults (ages 14-24) enrolled in urban health care clinics completed self-report questionnaires assessing CSA and other problem behaviors at enrollment and at 7 months. Results indicated that the stability of CSA self-report at two time points was poor (58% consistent nonreporters of CSA, 20% consistent reporters, 22% inconsistent reporters). Consistent and inconsistent reporters were differentiated on risk measures. Adolescents who endorsed more items from the CSA scale were five times more likely to be consistent reporters. In sum, adolescent CSA reporting was quite inconsistent over time. Using multi-item scales and assessing CSA at two time points enhances accuracy of reporting.",,,"Aalsma, MC|Blythe, MJ|Fortenberry, JD|Orr, DP|Zimet, GD","Aalsma, Matthew C.|Blythe, Margaret J.|Fortenberry, J.

"Background: Changes of albumin conformation flexibility and binding characteristics in plasma products can be determined by electron spin resonance spectroscopy (ESR) with spin probes as reporter molecules. Methods: Quality of albumin transport was analyzed in different processed plasma units using a new ESR method which provides estimation of albumin properties by examination of albumin molecular structure changes. Results: In serum of healthy donors could not be obtained any abnormalities. Transport function of albumin in plasma products can be influenced by various methods of plasma collection, preparation, and filtration. Evident are changes in capacity of fatty acid binding sites and ordering changes of bound substrates. Transport respiratory detoxification efficiency is decreased between 30% and 70% in all FFP compared to control values. Conclusions: ESR spectroscopy can be used as a quality test for plasma. The ESR technique has a big potential for determination of conformation changes of macromolecules and as a global tumor marker test for donor screening. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

"Objectives. This study compared HIV-associated sexual health history, risk perceptions, and sexual risk behaviors of low-income rural and nonrural African American women. Methods, A cross-sectional statewide survey of African American women (n = 571) attending federally funded Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children clinics was conducted. Results. Adjusted analyses indicated that rural women were more likely to report not being counseled about HIV during pregnancy (P = .001), that a sex partner had not been tested for HIV (P = .005), no preferred method of prevention because they did not worry about sexually transmitted diseases (P = .02), not using condoms (P = .009), and a belief that their partner was HIV negative, despite lack of testing (P = .04). Conclusions.

"Objective. To examine the role of self-esteem in predicting coitus initiation in a population of early adolescents. Methods. Questionnaires assessing coital status, self-esteem, and pubertal maturation were collected from 188 participants who had not engaged in coitus by enrollment. Data were collected longitudinally while the participants were in the seventh and ninth grade. Ages ranged from 12 to 14 (mean: 12.50; standard deviation: 0.57) at Time 1 and from 14 to 16 (mean: 14.30; standard deviation: 0.49) at Time 2. Results. Boys with higher self-esteem ratings at Time 1 were more likely to initiate intercourse by Time 2. Girls with higher self-esteem at Time 1 were more likely to remain virgins than girls with lower self-esteem. Pubertal status was unrelated to initiation of coitus in this sample. Conclusions. Self-esteem, regardless of pubertal status, predicted coitus transition differentially in boys and girls.

"Purpose. To validate the University of Michigan Global Rating Scale (GRS), a single,item, five-point global measure of faculty members' clinical teaching performances previously shown to be reliable. Method. In June 1998, 98 senior medical residents (98% of seniors) from four academic institutions completed the GRS for all teaching faculty at their institutions. Each resident also completed the 26-item Stanford Faculty Development questionnaire (SFDP26) for ten faculty with whom he or she had had teaching contact during residency. The SFDP26 is a validated instrument that measures seven specific aspects of clinical teaching (e.g., communication of goals, feedback). Results. The mean GRS score (SE) was 3.83 (.07). There was no difference in mean GRS or SFDP26 subscale scores across institutions. In a random-effects model that controlled for interrater reliability, correlation coefficients comparing the mean GRS scores and the mean scores for the individual SFDP26 subscales ranged from .86 to .98. Conclusions. The GRS correlates highly with measures of seven specific aspects of teaching effectiveness among senior medical residents. The GRS is a simple, readily administered measure of faculty's teaching performances that can be used by residency programs as part of an in, centive or reward program, to identify teachers as potential candidates for faculty development, or for consideration in promotion decisions.",,,"Babbott, SF|Hofer, TP|Litzelman, DK|Lubitz, RM|Williams, BC","Babbott, SF|Hofer, TP|Litzelman, Debra K.|Lubitz, RM|Williams, BC",177,-1,,,,,,,-1,,-1,,,,,,,,Article,10.1097/00001888-200202000-00020,,,,180,Clarivate Analytics Web of Science,,,,,,1040-2446,2,,,ACADEMIC MEDICINE,,,,MEDICINE,-1,,,,FEB,J,2002,,,,,,"Education, Scientific Disciplines|Health Care Sciences & Services",,-1,,Education & Educational Research; Health Care Sciences & Services,,43,Validation of a global measure of faculty's clinical teaching performance,44,,WOS:000173949200015,1,77,,11841985,C:\Users\mginda\Desktop\agc1\wos-extract.isi,"Williams BC, 2002, V77, P177, DOI 10.1097/00001888-200202000-00020"

"Two studies are described that attempt to determine if standard-scale-reduction techniques could yield a construct-valid diagnostic screen of pathology of separation-individuation for use in nonclinical university settings. In Study 1 (N = 210), a measure of pathology of separation-individuation (PATHSEP) was reduced successfully to a single, internally consistent factor, accounting for 36% of the variance. In Study 2 (N = 304), these items also coalesced around a single factor, accounting for 35% of the variance. Study 2 also showed that PATHSEP is correlated moderately and positively with indices of insecure attachment, with the Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression Scale, and with indices of psychiatric symptomatology (Hopkins Symptom Checklist). PATHSEP also was associated with a poorer profile of adjustment to college. Males reported more pathology of separation-individuation than did females. Evidence supports the construct validity of a shortened version of PATHSEP. Directions for future research are noted. (C) 2001 John Wiley & Sons.

"This study sought to determine HIV prevention strategies other than male condom use employed by low-income women who have sex with men (WSM) and to identify variables that predict use of these strategies. A cross-sectional survey of nearly 4,000 women receiving Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) benefits in 21 Missouri counties was conducted. The response rate was 58%, with 2,256 completed questionnaires returned. Women were asked to indicate one or more of nine methods they had ever used to prevent HIV infection. Women were also asked about their use of male condoms, preference for male condoms versus female condoms, and which partner usually made decisions about STD/HIV prevention. Of the 2,256 questionnaires returned, 1,325 WSM indicated use of at least one HIV prevention strategy other than condom use. Strategies were: being tested for HIV (68.2%), partner being tested for HIV (44.1%), asking partner about his sex history (41.1%), using oral contraceptives (18.8%), asking him if he has HIV (13.7%), douching (11.8%), withdrawal (9.4%), and having anal or oral sex (6.6%). Common predictors of these strategies were race, education, history of STD, condom use, and marital status. Basic misunderstandings about HIV prevention are common in specified subpopulations of low-income women. HIV prevention programs for low-income WSM should capitalize on women's efforts to prevent HIV by designing programs to help women replace ineffective prevention strategies with effective prevention strategies.",,,"Crosby, RA|Meyerson, BE|Yarber, WL","Crosby, Richard A.|Meyerson, Beth E.|Yarber, WL",53,-1,,,,,,,-1,,-1,,,,,,,,Article,10.1046/j.1525-1446.2000.00053.x,,,,60,Clarivate Analytics Web of Science,,,,,,0737-1209,1,,,PUBLIC HEALTH NURSING,,,,UNITED-STATES|AIDS RISK|SEX|POWER,-1,,,,JAN-FEB,J,2000,,,,,,"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health|Nursing",,-1,,"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health; Nursing",,21,Prevention strategies other than male condoms employed by low-income women to prevent HIV infection,22,,WOS:000084879000008,1,17,,10675053,C:\Users\mginda\Desktop\agc1\wos-extract.isi,"Crosby RA, 2000, V17, P53, DOI 10.1046/j.1525-1446.2000.00053.x"
